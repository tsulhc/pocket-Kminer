// The YAML decoder both binaries use is lenient: yaml.Unmarshal silently drops
// every key the struct does not have. That is not a defect of the library --
// yaml.v3 offers Decoder.KnownFields(true), which errors on an unknown key --
// but strict decoding was never evaluated here, in either direction. There was
// no comment, no doc and no commit that mentioned it; the repo instead grew one
// tombstone field per retired setting, each a hand-written reaction to one
// incident.
//
// Tombstones cannot cover the case that actually bites: a key that was never a
// field. config.miner.example.yaml shipped a `suppliers:` block promising
// "explicit control over which suppliers/services to handle" while no
// yaml:"suppliers" tag existed anywhere in the tree, so an operator who
// uncommented it believed they were filtering and the miner claimed for every
// key it held. Nobody buried that key because it was never removed -- it was
// never implemented.
//
// So the strict decode runs as a SECOND pass, purely as a diagnostic, and the
// two doors differ by what the caller is for:
//
//   - `validate` is strict by nature -- validating IS its job -- so an unknown
//     key there is a hard failure, no flag involved.
//   - The serving binary is friendly by default: it warns and starts, because
//     refusing to boot over a stale key would turn a rolling deploy into an
//     outage. --strict-config turns that same finding fatal for an operator who
//     wants the guarantee.
//
// Measured 2026-09-02: both example configs this repo publishes decode CLEAN
// under KnownFields(true) -- zero false positives against our own documentation
// -- and yaml.v3 penetrates the `yaml:",inline"` embedded structs, so a bad key
// inside an inline block is reported with its own type name.

// retiredKeys carries, for each setting this project removed, the sentence that
// says what its removal CHANGED for the operator.
//
// The generic "field X not found" line cannot carry that, and the difference is
// the whole value: an operator who reads "grace_period_extra_blocks not found"
// learns that a key is unknown, while the sentence below tells them their relays
// at the session edge will now be rejected instead of served for free. That
// knowledge was paid for with incidents; the struct fields that used to hold it
// were deleted because a field per retired key is config that configures nothing.
//
// A key is the bare field name, or TYPE.field with the type as yaml.v3 names it
// ("relayer.RelayMeterYAMLConfig.enabled") when the bare name is a leaf of other
// blocks too. The qualified form is tried first.
var retiredKeys = map[string]string{
	"relayer.RelayMeterYAMLConfig.enabled": "the relay meter can no longer be turned off: every relay is " +
		"charged against the application's stake before it is served. If this said \"false\", expect relays " +
		"beyond a session's claimable stake to be rejected where they used to be served for free",

	"grace_period_extra_blocks": "it extended the serve window past the chain's grace period on the admission " +
		"side only, so relays admitted in those extra blocks were served and then judged ineligible for " +
		"rewards -- served for free. Grace now follows the on-chain grace_period_end_offset_blocks exactly. " +
		"Expect relays arriving after the grace period to be rejected as expired instead of served unpaid",

	"service_factor_missing_ttl": "there is no absence left to remember: the relayer loads the miner's " +
		"COMPLETE service factor manifest at startup, so a service the manifest does not list has no override " +
		"as a matter of data rather than a failed lookup. Pricing is unchanged, but a relayer that starts " +
		"before the miner has published now refuses relays until the manifest arrives, where it used to serve " +
		"them priced by the protocol formula",

	"smst_cold_tree_compaction": "claimed SMSTs are now ALWAYS stored as a compressed blob of their leaves " +
		"once their claim is sent, and their nodes hash is deleted; the proof rebuilds the tree in memory from " +
		"the blob. There is no way to turn it off. If this said \"false\", expect far less Redis memory per " +
		"claimed session and a proof that rebuilds its tree first. Do not roll the miner back to a version " +
		"without compaction while compacted sessions await their proof: it cannot read the blob",

	"fail_behavior": "the relayer now refuses a relay whose budget it cannot verify, and never chooses to " +
		"serve one. If this said \"open\", expect relays to be rejected during an outage of the meter's " +
		"store that were previously served unbilled",

	"redis_key_prefix": "meter keys now derive from redis.namespace. A different prefix would have moved them " +
		"mid-session, silently resetting in-flight session budgets. Do NOT point redis.namespace.base_prefix " +
		"at the retired value to preserve them: that relocates the ENTIRE keyspace, including the WAL stream " +
		"the miner consumes from. Meter keys are ephemeral and session-scoped, so a drained fleet migrates " +
		"with nothing to move",

	"hot_reload_enabled": "the setting moved to keys.hot_reload_enabled, which the miner and the relayer " +
		"share. A deployment that set it at the top level ran with key hot reload OFF while its own config " +
		"said ON, so a key added or pulled never reached the process. Set keys.hot_reload_enabled instead",

	"keys_dir": "loading supplier keys from a directory is no longer supported. Use keys.keys_file or " +
		"keys.keyring",

	"disable_claim_batching": "claims are now ALWAYS batched by session end height and there is no way to " +
		"submit them one per transaction. If this said \"true\", expect one transaction per (supplier, session " +
		"end height) instead of one per claim -- fewer transactions per window, which is what the startup " +
		"warning used to ask for. Batching is no longer a choice on either side: proofs always travel one per " +
		"transaction and claims always travel grouped",

	"disable_proof_batching": "proofs are now ALWAYS submitted one per transaction and there is no way to " +
		"group them again. A batch dies whole, so one message the chain refuses forfeited every other proof " +
		"riding with it. If this said \"false\" (the default), expect one transaction per proof instead of one " +
		"per (supplier, session end height) -- a session needing a proof is the exception, so this is a small " +
		"increase, not one transaction per session. If it said \"true\", nothing changes: that is now the only " +
		"behaviour. Claims went the other way and lost their switch too: they are ALWAYS batched by " +
		"session end height, and disable_claim_batching is retired -- see its own entry above",

	"tx_timeout_min_seconds": "the transaction broadcast deadline is no longer configurable. It is derived " +
		"per network as the claim or proof window in blocks times block_time_seconds, capped just below the " +
		"cosmos-sdk unordered-TX ceiling, and it is the same for every attempt inside one window. This key " +
		"was the most dangerous of the four: the floor was applied WITHOUT being capped against that " +
		"ceiling, so a value above 600 made the chain reject every claim and proof with \"unordered tx ttl " +
		"exceeds 10m0s\" -- no revenue, and PROOF_MISSING forfeits. Expect the deadline to follow the " +
		"window instead of whatever was set here",

	"tx_timeout_max_seconds": "the transaction broadcast deadline is no longer configurable; see " +
		"tx_timeout_min_seconds. The protection this one carried is KEPT and is no longer optional: the " +
		"derived deadline is still capped below the cosmos-sdk unordered-TX ceiling, which is what prevents " +
		"\"unordered tx ttl exceeds 10m0s\" rejections. Expect no change unless this was set above the " +
		"ceiling, which the cap was already correcting silently",

	"tx_timeout_default_seconds": "the transaction broadcast deadline is no longer configurable; see " +
		"tx_timeout_min_seconds. This key configured a branch production never took: it applied only when " +
		"no window was supplied, and all three submission paths -- claim, proof and reconciler resend -- " +
		"always supply one. Expect no change in behaviour",

	"tx_timeout_clock_skew_buffer_seconds": "the transaction broadcast deadline is no longer configurable; " +
		"see tx_timeout_min_seconds. Nothing is subtracted for clock drift any more, because there is none " +
		"left to absorb: the deadline is anchored on the chain's own latest_block_time rather than on this " +
		"host's wall clock, and the transaction also carries a timeout_height the chain enforces against " +
		"its own block height. Expect deadlines longer than before by whatever this was set to, and still " +
		"inside the window",

	"disable_inclusion_reconciler": "inclusion reconciliation is now MANDATORY and there is no way to " +
		"turn it off. If this said \"true\", that deployment was running fire-once: a claim or proof accepted " +
		"into the mempool but never included in a block was never verified and never re-sent, which is exactly " +
		"how a CLAIM_MISSING / PROOF_MISSING forfeit happens in silence. Two costs arrive with the switch and " +
		"were NOT chosen by whoever set it: the reconciler queries the chain once per owned supplier per block " +
		"(AllClaims/AllProofs), and every re-broadcast is a transaction that pays gas. If that is why it was " +
		"off, max_rebroadcasts: 0 is the surviving knob -- observe-only, it verifies and records the outcome " +
		"but never re-sends. If this said \"false\" (the default), nothing changes: that is now the only " +
		"behaviour",

	"smst_live_root_checkpoint_interval": "the SMST root is no longer checkpointed every N relays, so there " +
		"is no interval left to tune. The miner writes it once per relay batch, before it acknowledges any " +
		"relay in that batch, so a relay a resumed tree lacks is one still pending in the stream, and it is " +
		"redelivered to the next owner. Where this bounded the relays a miner restart could lose per session " +
		"to the interval minus one, expect those relays to come back through redelivery instead, whatever " +
		"it said, including \"1\" -- provided the redelivery lands before the session is sealed",

	"deduplication_ttl_blocks": "the miner never read it: it builds its relay deduplicator without " +
		"it, so the window was a fixed 10 blocks whatever this said, and it still is -- converted to time " +
		"with block_time_seconds. Expect no change in behaviour",
