The relayers and miners of a deployment share one Redis. The relayer validates,
charges and serves relays and publishes them to Redis Streams; the miner builds
the claim trees from those streams and submits claims and proofs. All session
state lives in Redis.

Start with AGENTS.md or docs/deploy/README.md in the repository.`,
