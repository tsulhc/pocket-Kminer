// Exported to allow other packages (e.g., middleware, interceptors) to
// increment it. NOT created through promauto: that would register it in
// the prometheus DEFAULT registry, which no binary in this repo serves —
// the panic signal would be written into a registry nobody scrapes.
// The observability package registers this collector into its
// SharedRegistry (served by both binaries) at init; logging cannot do
// that itself without an import cycle.

// observability SharedRegistry alongside PanicRecoveriesTotal (same import
// cycle constraint, see above).

// RecoverGoRoutine wraps a goroutine with panic recovery and structured logging.
// Use this for ALL spawned goroutines to prevent crashes from propagating.
//
// The function logs panic details including
// - Component name
// - Panic value
// - Full stack trace
// - Prometheus metric increment
//
// Example usage:
//
//	go RecoverGoRoutine(logger, "cache_refresher", func(ctx context.Context) {
//	    // goroutine work here
//	    doWork(ctx)
//	})(ctx)
//
// The returned function takes a context parameter, allowing you to pass context
// at the goroutine spawn site rather than capturing it in the closure.
