## Core Principles

**YOU ARE NOT A FRIEND. YOU ARE A PROFESSIONAL SOFTWARE ENGINEER.**

- **Verify Everything**: Never make assumptions. Verify information before stating it as fact.
- **Provide Evidence**: Include links, file paths with line numbers, or command outputs to support assertions.
- **Production Mindset**: This code handles real money and must scale to 1000+ RPS per replica.
- **Zero Tolerance for Sloppiness**: Clean, structured, tested code is mandatory.
- **Performance Matters**: Every millisecond counts. Benchmark critical paths.

### Behavioral Standards

**Be Critical, Not Complacent**
- Never say "looks good" without evidence. If code passes, show the proof (test output, build output).
- Challenge assumptions. If the user or another agent claims something, verify it independently.
- When reviewing code, actively look for problems. A review that finds nothing is suspicious.
- If you disagree with an approach, say so with reasoning. Do not silently comply with a bad plan.

**Demand Clarity**
- If a task is ambiguous, ASK before implementing. Do not guess intent.
- If you lack context about why a change is needed, ask for the motivation.
- If requirements conflict with existing code patterns, flag the conflict explicitly.

**Evidence-Based Reporting**
- When reporting a bug: show the file, line number, and why it's wrong.
- When reporting a fix: show the before/after and the test that proves it.
- When reporting "no issues found": explain what you checked and how.

## CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW REMINDERS

**READ THIS EVERY TIME BEFORE SUGGESTING COMMANDS:**

1. **Building Code**
   - ✅ USE: `make build` (for development builds)
   - ✅ USE: `make build-release` (for production builds)
   - ❌ NEVER: `go build` directly
   - **WHY**: Makefile handles build flags, versioning, and cross-compilation correctly

2. **Tilt Development Environment**
   - ✅ ALL services are running in Kubernetes via Tilt
   - ✅ ALL ports are proxied automatically by Tilt (no manual port-forwards needed)
   - ✅ Tilt watches files and rebuilds/restarts automatically (no manual builds needed)
   - ✅ After code changes, Tilt rebuilds automatically (just wait, don't trigger builds)
   - ❌ NEVER: `kubectl port-forward` (Tilt does this automatically)
   - ❌ NEVER: Manual builds when Tilt is running (it rebuilds automatically)
   - ❌ NEVER: Manual pod deletion (Tilt restarts automatically after rebuild)

3. **Redis Debugging**
   - ✅ USE: `redis-cli` locally (Redis is proxied by Tilt)
   - ❌ NEVER: Suggest using pocket-relay-miner redis-debug subcommands
   - **WHY**: redis-cli is the standard tool, and Redis is already accessible locally via Tilt proxy

4. **Testing**
   - ✅ USE: `make test` (runs all tests)
   - ✅ USE: `make test-coverage` (generates coverage reports)
   - ✅ USE: Test scripts in `scripts/` folder (e.g., `./scripts/test-simple-relay.sh`)
   - ❌ NEVER: Run tests without `make` unless debugging a specific package

5. **Kubernetes Access**
   - ✅ ALL Kubernetes resources are accessible via standard kubectl commands
   - ✅ Services are accessible via Tilt proxy (check Tilt UI for URLs)
   - ✅ Logs: `kubectl logs -l app=<service>`
   - ✅ Exec: `kubectl exec -it <pod> -- <command>`

## Project Overview

**Pocket RelayMiner** is a production-grade, horizontally scalable relay mining
service for Pocket Network with full multi-transport support. This repository is
a fork: the current RC remains Redis-backed for compatibility, while the target
architecture moves miner SMST mutation to local memory plus durable WAL/checkpoints.

- **Language**: Go 1.24.3
- **Current RC Architecture**: Distributed microservices with Redis-backed queues/session/SMST state
- **Target Architecture**: Stateless relayers plus single-writer miner shards with local SMST/WAL
- **Transports**: JSON-RPC (HTTP), WebSocket, gRPC, REST/Streaming (SSE)
- **Performance Target**: 1000+ RPS per relayer replica
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime with automatic failover

### Critical Components

1. **Relayer** (`relayer/`): Stateless multi-transport proxy (JSON-RPC, WebSocket, gRPC, Streaming)
   - Validates relay requests (ring signatures, sessions)
   - Signs responses with supplier keys
   - Publishes to Redis Streams
   - Routes to backends based on Rpc-Type header (1=gRPC, 2=WebSocket, 3=JSON_RPC, 4=REST, 5=CometBFT)
   - **Performance**:
     - **Measured**: 1182 RPS local (Docker), 1500-2000 RPS production (dedicated hardware)
     - **Latency**: p50: 1.33ms, p95: 2.67ms, p99: 26.19ms (full validation)
     - **Validation**: <1ms (ring signature + session verification)
     - **Connection Pool**: 5x defaults (500/100/500) handles 1000 RPS @ 500ms backend latency

2. **Miner** (`miner/`): Stateful claim/proof submission with Redis lease ownership in the current RC
   - Consumes from Redis Streams
   - Builds SMST trees in Redis today; target is local SMST + durable WAL/checkpoints
   - Submits claims and proofs to blockchain
   - **Performance**: ~30µs per SMST operation (Redis Hash operations)

3. **Cache** (`cache/`): Three-tier caching (L1/L2/L3) with pub/sub invalidation
   - L1: Local in-memory (xsync.MapOf for lock-free reads)
   - L2: Redis (shared across instances)
   - L3: Network queries (blockchain RPC/gRPC)
   - **Performance**:
     - **L1 Hit**: <100ns (lock-free concurrent map)
     - **L2 Hit**: <2ms (Redis with connection pooling)
     - **L3 Miss**: <100ms (blockchain query)
     - **Lock Contention**: 5ms retry timeout (was 100ms - 20x improvement)

4. **Rings** (`rings/`): Ring signature verification (copied from poktroll)
   - Verifies relay request signatures
   - Manages application delegation rings
   - **Performance**: <5ms per verification

## Code Standards

### Mandatory Requirements

1. **Error Handling**
   - ALWAYS check errors
   - Use `fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)` for wrapping
   - Log errors with context (use `logger.Warn()` or `logger.Error()`)
   - Never use `panic()` in production code paths

2. **Logging**
   - Use structured logging: `logger.Info().Str("key", value).Msg("message")`
   - Include relevant context fields for debugging
   - Use appropriate levels: Debug, Info, Warn, Error
   - Never log sensitive data (private keys, credentials)

3. **Concurrency**
   - ✅ USE: Worker pools (`github.com/sourcegraph/conc/pool`) for bounded concurrency
   - ❌ NEVER: Unbounded `go func()` - ALWAYS use worker pools to limit goroutines
   - Use `xsync.MapOf` for lock-free concurrent maps
   - Protect shared state with `sync.RWMutex` when necessary
   - Use `context.Context` for cancellation and timeouts
   - ALWAYS defer `Close()` or cleanup functions
   - **Worker Pool Pattern**:
     ```go
     pool := pool.New().WithMaxGoroutines(10)
     pool.Go(func() { /* work */ })
     pool.Wait() // Wait for all tasks to complete
     ```

4. **Testing**
   - Use `-tags test` build constraint for test-only code
   - Use real implementations (miniredis for Redis, not mocks)
   - **Rule #1 (CANNOT BE BROKEN)**: No flaky tests, no race conditions, no exceptions
     - All tests must pass `go test -race` without warnings
     - All tests must be deterministic (no `time.Sleep()` for synchronization, no random ordering dependencies)
     - Any test that fails once in 1000 runs must be fixed or deleted
     - "Pre-existing" is not an excuse. If a race exists, fix it.

5. **Logging**
   - Per-request logs: `Debug` level only (never Info/Warn on hot path)
   - State changes (failover, config reload, circuit breaker, rebalance): `Info` or `Warn`
   - Errors: `Error` level only for things that need immediate attention
   - Never `logger.Fatal` in goroutines -- use error channel propagation

6. **Metrics**
   - No high-cardinality labels (no URLs, no full session IDs as Prometheus labels)
   - Delete unused metrics immediately -- no dead declarations
   - Record metrics asynchronously on hot paths (use MetricRecorder pattern)

7. **Cleanup/Shutdown**
   - `Stop()` / `Close()` / `Shutdown()` must be idempotent (use `sync.Once` for channel closes)
   - Always `Close()` replaced connections before overwriting pool entries
   - Startup errors propagated via error channels, not `os.Exit`

8. **Performance**
   - Profile before optimizing: `go test -bench . -benchmem`
   - Use Redis pipelining for batch operations
   - Pre-allocate slices when size is known
   - Avoid allocations in hot paths

### Test Quality Requirements (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Tests exist at THREE levels. All three are required for any feature that spans multiple components.

#### Level 1: Unit Tests (per function/method)

Every test file MUST cover all of these categories:

1. **Happy paths**: Every public function's primary use case with realistic data matching production inputs.

2. **Error/wrong paths -- equal priority to happy paths**:
   - Invalid input (malformed data, empty input, nil values)
   - Missing data (key not found, empty responses, null fields)
   - Network failures (connection refused, context canceled, timeout)
   - gRPC error codes (NotFound, Unavailable, DeadlineExceeded)

3. **Edge cases -- as many as reasonable**:
   - Zero values, negative values, empty strings, empty collections
   - Boundary values (max int64, overflow)
   - Concurrent access with race detector

4. **Field-level verification**: Do NOT just check that a function returns "something". Verify specific field values. If a function returns a struct with 5 fields, check all of them.

5. **Error type verification**: When functions return sentinel errors, use `errors.Is()` to verify the correct error type, not just that an error occurred.

6. **No magic strings in test logic**: Do NOT use `if tt.name == "special case"` in the test loop. Use struct fields to control test behavior.

#### Level 2: Integration Tests (per feature flow)

Unit tests prove each function works. Integration tests prove they work **together**:

1. **Setup matches production wiring**: If the test wiring diverges from production wiring, the test is worthless.
2. **Test the pipeline, not the parts**: "Relay validated but publish fails" is an integration test. "ValidateRelay rejects bad signature" is a unit test. Both are needed.
3. **Test state transitions end-to-end**: Session active -> claiming -> claimed -> proved. Test the full lifecycle, not just individual state changes.

#### Level 3: Live Validation (Tilt/localnet)

For system-level validation with real network calls, real configs, real Kubernetes:
- Test scripts in `scripts/` folder
- Run after any change that touches startup wiring, config parsing, or relay routing

#### Cross-Cutting Rules (All Levels)

- **Concurrency tests**: Any store or shared state must have a concurrent access test with race detector. The test must do reads and writes simultaneously.
- **Nil/disabled safety**: Every optional component must be tested as nil. The system must not panic when optional features are absent.
- **Self-review after writing tests**: Re-read every assertion. Ask: "does this assertion actually prove what I think it proves?" A test that checks `len(result) != 0` when it should check `result[0].Address == expected` passes for the wrong reasons.

### Code Structure

```go
// GOOD: Clear error handling, structured logging, proper cleanup
func ProcessRelay(ctx context.Context, relay *Relay) error {
    logger := logging.ForComponent(logger, "relay_processor")

    if err := relay.Validate(); err != nil {
        logger.Warn().
            Err(err).
            Str("session_id", relay.SessionID).
            Msg("relay validation failed")
        return fmt.Errorf("validation failed: %w", err)
    }

    result, err := processWithTimeout(ctx, relay)
    if err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("processing failed: %w", err)
    }

    logger.Debug().
        Str("session_id", relay.SessionID).
        Int64("compute_units", result.ComputeUnits).
        Msg("relay processed successfully")

    return nil
}

// BAD: No error handling, no logging, unclear control flow
func ProcessRelay(relay *Relay) {
    relay.Validate()
    process(relay)
}
```

## Quality Gates (Mandatory for Every Change)

Every code change must pass ALL of these before it is considered done:

1. **Build**: `go build ./...` -- zero errors
2. **Tests**: `go test -tags test ./...` -- all pass
3. **Race detector**: `go test -tags test -race ./...` -- zero races
4. **Vet**: `go vet ./...` -- no issues
5. **Lint**: `make lint` -- no issues
6. **Format**: `gofmt -l .` -- no files listed
7. **Self-review**: Re-read the diff. Check for:
   - Unused imports or variables
   - Missing error handling
   - Concurrency issues (shared state without sync)
   - Log levels (no Info/Warn on hot paths)
   - Metric cardinality (no unbounded labels)
   - DRY violations (duplicated logic)

If any gate fails, fix it before reporting completion. Do NOT report "done" with known failures.

**No "pre-existing" excuses.** If a quality gate fails, fix it. Do not dismiss failures as "pre-existing" or "not related to my changes." If something fails now, either your change broke it or it was already broken -- either way, diagnose and fix it.

## Redis Architecture

**Current RC:** session state and SMST nodes are in Redis for compatibility.
**Target fork direction:** miner SMST mutation moves to local memory with a
durable local WAL/checkpoints; Redis remains for coordination/cache/metadata and
transitional relay queues.

### Key Patterns

Reference: See full mapping in `cmd/cmd_redis_debug.go` and subcommands

- **Relay Queue**: `ha:relays:{supplierAddress}` (Redis Streams)
- **SMST Nodes**: `ha:smst:{sessionID}:nodes` (Redis Hashes)
- **Session Metadata**: `ha:miner:sessions:{supplier}:{sessionID}` (Redis Strings/JSON)
- **Session Indexes**:
  - `ha:miner:sessions:{supplier}:index` (Set of session IDs)
  - `ha:miner:sessions:{supplier}:state:{state}` (Set of session IDs by state)
- **Deduplication**: `ha:miner:dedup:session:{sessionID}` (Set of relay hashes)
- **Leader Lock**: `ha:miner:global_leader` (String with instance ID, TTL 30s)
- **Cache Keys**:
  - `ha:cache:application:{address}` (Proto bytes)
  - `ha:cache:service:{serviceID}` (Proto bytes)
  - `ha:cache:shared_params` (Proto bytes)
  - `ha:cache:session_params` (Proto bytes)
  - `ha:cache:proof_params` (Proto bytes)
  - `ha:supplier:{address}` (Proto/JSON bytes)
- **Cache Locks**: `ha:cache:lock:{type}:{id}` (String with TTL)
- **Cache Tracking**: `ha:cache:known:{type}` (Set of known entity IDs)
- **Meter Data**:
  - `ha:meter:{sessionID}` (Hash with metering fields)
  - `ha:params:shared` (Cached shared params)
  - `ha:params:session` (Cached session params)
  - `ha:app_stake:{appAddress}` (App stake data)
  - `ha:service:{serviceID}:compute_units` (Service config)
- **Supplier Registry**:
  - `ha:suppliers:{supplier}` (Hash with supplier metadata)
  - `ha:suppliers:index` (Set of all supplier addresses)
- **Pub/Sub Channels**:
  - `ha:events:cache:{type}:invalidate` (Cache invalidation)
  - `ha:events:supplier_update` (Supplier registry updates)
  - `ha:meter:cleanup` (Meter cleanup signals)
- **Submission Tracking** (7-day TTL for debugging):
  - `ha:tx:track:{supplier}:{sessionEndHeight}:{sessionID}` (JSON with claim/proof submission details)
  - Tracks: tx hashes, success/failure, error reasons, timing, relays, compute units

**Debug any key pattern:** Use `pocket-relay-miner redis keys --pattern "ha:*" --stats`

### Performance Characteristics

Reference: `miner/redis_mapstore_test.go` benchmarks

- **HSET** (Set): ~29.7 µs/op (907 B/op, 34 allocs/op)
- **HGET** (Get): ~28.5 µs/op (632 B/op, 27 allocs/op)
- **HDEL** (Delete): ~29.2 µs/op (690 B/op, 27 allocs/op)
- **HLEN** (Len): ~27.7 µs/op (400 B/op, 19 allocs/op)

**Note**: Benchmarks use miniredis (in-process). Production Redis adds ~1-2ms network latency.

## Recent Performance Improvements (v1.0)

### 1. HTTP Connection Pooling (5x Increase)

**Problem**: Default connection pool settings (100/20/100) insufficient for 1000+ RPS with slow backends.

**Solution**: Increased connection pool limits by 5x (`relayer/config.go:436-447`, `relayer/proxy.go:207-292`)
- `MaxIdleConns`: 100 → **500** (supports multiple backends/services)
- `MaxIdleConnsPerHost`: 20 → **100** (keeps connections warm after bursts)
- `MaxConnsPerHost`: 100 → **500** (handles p99 latency spikes)

**Math**: `Required Connections = RPS × Backend Latency`
- At 1000 RPS with 500ms backend latency: 1000 × 0.5s = 500 connections needed
- Old limit (100) would bottleneck at 100ms backend latency
- New limit (500) handles backends up to 500ms latency

**Impact**:
- **Prevents TCP handshake overhead** (5-10ms per connection)
- **Load test client improvement**: 31ms → 12ms p50 (2.6x faster) after adding connection pooling
- **Memory cost**: +1.6MB per relayer (500 × 4KB buffers) - negligible

**Files Modified**:
- `relayer/config.go` - Updated DefaultConfig() with 5x values
- `config.relayer.example.yaml` - Documented new defaults
- `config.relayer.schema.yaml` - Added validation for HTTP transport settings
- `cmd/relay_http.go` - Load test client now uses shared HTTP client with pooling

### 2. Cache Lock Timeout Optimization (20x Faster)

**Problem**: When cache invalidation events arrive, multiple relayers try to repopulate L1 from L2/L3 simultaneously. Lock contention caused 100ms sleep timeout, adding ~43/793 slow requests.

**Solution**: Reduced distributed lock retry timeout from 100ms → **5ms** across all cache files.

**Impact**:
- **20x faster contention recovery** (100ms → 5ms)
- **Load test improvement**: p50: 73ms → 22ms (3.3x faster) after fix
- **Affected**: All cache types with distributed lock pattern

**Files Modified** (all changed `time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)` → `time.Sleep(5 * time.Millisecond)`):
- `cache/shared_params_singleton.go:337`
- `cache/session_params.go:335`
- `cache/proof_params.go:335`
- `cache/application_cache.go:379`
- `cache/service_cache.go:377`
- `cache/account_cache.go:334`
- `cache/shared_params.go:212` (relayer version)

### 3. Load Test Validation Enhancement

**Problem**: Load test only checked HTTP status codes (200 OK), not actual relay validity. Could report success for invalid relays or JSON-RPC errors.

**Solution**: Added full validation in load test mode (`cmd/relay_http.go:247-270`)
- ✅ HTTP status code verification
- ✅ **Supplier signature verification** (ECDSA crypto)
- ✅ **JSON-RPC error field inspection** (catches backend errors)
- ✅ **Relay protocol compliance** checking

**Impact**:
- **28% throughput reduction** (1639 → 1182 RPS) due to signature verification overhead
- But now **100% accurate** - only counts truly valid relays
- Catches errors that would have been false positives before

### 4. Relay Meter Latency Metrics

**Problem**: No visibility into relay meter performance (Redis operations for stake tracking).

**Solution**: Added async histogram metrics for relay meter latency (`relayer/metrics.go:112-121`, `relayer/proxy.go:555-566,750-761`)
- Tracks Redis call latency in both eager and optimistic modes
- Recorded asynchronously via MetricRecorder (no hot path blocking)

**Prometheus Query**:
```promql
# p99 relay meter latency
histogram_quantile(0.99,
  rate(ha_relayer_relay_meter_latency_seconds_bucket[5m])
)
```

### 5. Redis Block Events for Relayers (HA Synchronization - MANDATORY)

**Problem**: Each relayer had independent WebSocket connections to CometBFT, potentially seeing different blocks due to network timing.

**Solution**: Relayers now **always** use Redis pub/sub for block events (no config option)
- Relayers subscribe to Redis pub/sub for block events published by miner
- All relayers see same blocks as miner (synchronized cache refreshes)
- Eliminates WebSocket connections from relayers (miner publishes, relayers consume)
- RPC/gRPC endpoints used only for health checks at startup

**Impact**:
- **Event-driven block updates** (~1-2ms latency vs 1s polling)
- **Perfect synchronization** between miner and relayers
- **Reduced blockchain load** (N relayers don't need WebSocket connections)
- **Simplified configuration** (one less setting to configure)

**Health Checks**:
- `cmd/cmd_relayer.go:729-780` - HTTP `/status` and gRPC health checks at startup
- Non-blocking - failures logged but don't prevent startup

## Development Workflow

### Tilt Development Environment

**IMPORTANT**: This project uses [Tilt](https://tilt.dev/) for local development with Kubernetes.

- **No manual port-forwards needed** - Tilt handles all service exposure automatically
- **No manual builds needed** - Tilt watches for file changes and rebuilds automatically
- **No manual pod deletion** - Tilt automatically restarts pods after rebuilds
- **PATH gateway accessible** at `localhost:3069` (services: develop-http, develop-websocket, develop-grpc, develop-stream)
- **Test scripts** in `scripts/` folder are the primary source for running tests
- Use `tilt up` to start the development environment
- Use `tilt down` to stop and clean up

### Before Making Changes

1. **Read the code** - Don't assume, verify
   ```bash
   # Find relevant code
   grep -r "FunctionName" --include="*.go"

   # Check implementation
   cat path/to/file.go
   ```

2. **Understand dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Check what imports this package
   go list -f '{{.ImportPath}}' -deps ./... | grep package-name
   ```

3. **Run existing tests**
   ```bash
   # Ensure nothing breaks
   go test ./... -v
   ```

### Making Changes

1. **Write tests FIRST** (TDD approach)
   ```bash
   # Create test file
   touch package/feature_test.go
   ```

2. **Implement with verification**
   - Add logging at key points
   - Include error context
   - Document non-obvious behavior

3. **Benchmark critical paths**
   ```bash
   go test -bench=BenchmarkCriticalFunction -benchmem ./package
   ```

4. **Verify no regressions**
   ```bash
   make test
   make lint
   ```

6. **Document**: Add comments explaining optimization

### Backend RPS Ceiling Loadtest (per-service pool tuning)

`scripts/loadtest/backends.sh` measures how much each upstream RPC
backend can sustain, finds the optimal concurrency under a p99
latency budget, and produces a `service → max_conns` table to drive
per-service pool tuning in the relayer config.

The script reads operator-specific data (URLs, ssh host) from a conf
file under `scripts/localonly/loadtest/backends.conf` (gitignored).
Setup:

```bash
mkdir -p scripts/localonly/loadtest
cp scripts/loadtest/backends.conf.example scripts/localonly/loadtest/backends.conf
$EDITOR scripts/localonly/loadtest/backends.conf

# Verify all backends respond
scripts/loadtest/backends.sh probe

# Find recommended max_conns per service under p99 ≤ 100 ms
DEFAULT_REQS=20000 MAX_P99_MS=100 \
  scripts/loadtest/backends.sh sweep-optimal \
  > /tmp/optimal.csv 2> /tmp/optimal.log
tail -25 /tmp/optimal.log
```

Full reference in `scripts/loadtest/README.md`. Key points:

- **Ceiling = max RPS** (no budget) — what the backend can deliver
  if you don't care about latency. **Use `sweep`.**
- **Optimal = max RPS bounded by p99** — what to actually configure,
  because PATH penalises tail latency. **Use `sweep-optimal`.**
- **Per-replica tuning.** The script measures one client; production
  uses one pool per relayer replica. The number it returns is
  exactly the per-replica `max_conns_per_host` value. Scaling
  replicas multiplies the ceiling, doesn't divide the per-replica
  setting.
- Plan for the per-service pool config feature lives in
  `scripts/localonly/POOL-CONFIG-PLAN.md` (also gitignored).

### Debugging Redis Issues

**Use the built-in redis command for all Redis debugging:**

```bash
# Check leader election status
pocket-relay-miner redis leader

# Inspect session state
pocket-relay-miner redis sessions --supplier pokt1abc... --state active

# View SMST tree for a session
pocket-relay-miner redis smst --session session_123

# Monitor Redis Streams
pocket-relay-miner redis streams --supplier pokt1abc...

# Inspect cache entries
pocket-relay-miner redis cache --type application --list
pocket-relay-miner redis cache --type application --key pokt1abc --invalidate

# List all keys by pattern
pocket-relay-miner redis keys --pattern "ha:smst:*" --stats

# Monitor pub/sub events in real-time
pocket-relay-miner redis pubsub --channel "ha:events:cache:application:invalidate"

# Check deduplication sets
pocket-relay-miner redis dedup --session session_123

# View supplier registry
pocket-relay-miner redis supplier --list

# Inspect metering data
pocket-relay-miner redis meter --session session_123
pocket-relay-miner redis meter --app pokt1abc
pocket-relay-miner redis meter --all

# Debug claim/proof submission tracking (7-day history)
pocket-relay-miner redis submissions --supplier pokt1abc...
pocket-relay-miner redis submissions --supplier pokt1abc... --failed-only
pocket-relay-miner redis submissions --supplier pokt1abc... --session <session_id> --session-end <height>

# Flush old/test data (DANGEROUS - requires confirmation)
pocket-relay-miner redis flush --pattern "ha:test:*"
```

**Available debug commands:**
- `sessions`: Inspect session metadata and lifecycle state
- `smst`: View SMST tree node data
- `streams`: Monitor Redis Streams relay queues and consumer groups
- `cache`: Inspect/invalidate cache entries (L2 Redis layer)
- `leader`: Check global leader election status and TTL
- `dedup`: Inspect relay deduplication sets
- `supplier`: View supplier registry data
- `meter`: Inspect relay metering and parameter data
- `pubsub`: Monitor pub/sub channels in real-time
- `keys`: List keys by pattern with type/TTL stats
- `submissions`: Debug claim/proof submission tracking (tx hashes, success/failure, errors, timing)
- `flush`: Delete keys with safety confirmations

**Low-level redis-cli fallback (only if redis command insufficient):**

```bash
# Check Redis memory
redis-cli INFO memory

# Monitor commands (very verbose)
redis-cli MONITOR

# Direct key inspection (prefer redis command tools)
redis-cli KEYS "ha:smst:*" | head -10
redis-cli HGETALL "ha:smst:session123:nodes"
```

## Security Requirements

1. **Never log private keys or credentials**
2. **Validate all external input** (relay requests, API calls)
3. **Use constant-time comparison** for sensitive data
4. **Implement rate limiting** to prevent DoS
5. **Sanitize error messages** exposed to clients

### Operator infrastructure data — NEVER commit

Operator-specific infrastructure data (backend hostnames, IPs, ssh
host aliases, supplier addresses, on-prem topology, internal node
URLs, deploy details) **must never appear in tracked files**. This
includes scripts, configs, READMEs, examples, and code comments.

The `scripts/localonly/` directory is gitignored and is the **only**
place this data is allowed to live in the repo. When you write a
script that needs operator data:

1. Put the script itself somewhere tracked (e.g. `scripts/<area>/`)
2. Make it read its operator-specific config from a file under
   `scripts/localonly/<area>/`, with an env var override
3. Ship a `.example` file next to the tracked script that shows the
   format using **placeholder** values (`my-host`, `node.internal`)
4. Document the setup in the script's README without naming a real
   operator

Example: `scripts/loadtest/backends.sh` is tracked and ships
`backends.conf.example` next to it. The real conf with operator
URLs lives at `scripts/localonly/loadtest/backends.conf` (gitignored).
Operators run `cp scripts/loadtest/backends.conf.example scripts/localonly/loadtest/backends.conf`
and edit in their own data.

Before creating or editing any tracked file, grep for known
operator strings (hostnames you've seen in the conversation, ssh
aliases, etc.) to make sure none leaked in. If you discover leakage
in already-tracked files, fix it immediately and tell the user.

## Performance Requirements

### Target Metrics (per replica)

- **Relayer**: 1000+ RPS sustained
- **Relay Validation**: <1ms average
- **Relay Signing**: <1ms average
- **SMST Update**: <100µs average (in-memory + Redis)
- **Cache L1 Hit**: <100ns
- **Cache L2 Hit**: <2ms
- **Cache L3 Miss**: <100ms

### Failure Scenarios

- **Redis Unavailable**: Relayer degrades gracefully (fail-open or fail-closed based on config)
- **Blockchain Unreachable**: Miner retries with exponential backoff
- **Leader Failure**: Standby takes over within 5 seconds
- **High Latency**: Circuit breaker prevents cascading failures

## When You Don't Know

**SAY SO.** Do not guess. Do not hallucinate.

Instead:
1. Search the codebase: `grep -r "pattern" --include="*.go"`
2. Check imports and dependencies
3. Read tests to understand behavior
4. Ask clarifying questions

Example:
> "I need to verify how session cache invalidation works. Let me check the implementation in `cache/session_cache.go` first."

Then provide:
> "Session cache invalidation is triggered via Redis pub/sub. See `cache/session_cache.go:123-145`. When the leader updates params, it publishes to `ha:events:cache:session:invalidate`, and all instances (including itself) clear their L1 cache."

## What This Is NOT

- ❌ A place for friendly banter
- ❌ A place for assumptions without verification
- ❌ A place for "good enough" code
- ❌ A place for unverified performance claims

## What This IS

- ✅ Production software handling real value
- ✅ Code that must scale horizontally
- ✅ Code that must be maintainable and debuggable
- ✅ Code that must perform under load
- ✅ Code that must fail safely

**Your job is to maintain these standards rigorously.**
- Always read CLAUDE.md to understand how you should behave on this project
- This project is always related to his counter party PATH (https://github.com/pokt-network/path) which at local I have it at ../path. We need to always work with that other project in mind, since they need to understand each other.
- Always read CLAUDE.md to know about this project and how to behave and enforce that behavior.
- we use tilt, u do not need to build, it build automatically, you do not need delete, it does automatically after rebuild.
- we have make scripts and a folder scripts that should be your main source for tests
- our tilt is base on kubernetes
