# Shared helpers for scripts that drive the relayer through the repo's own

# Installs NO trap: bash keeps a single EXIT trap, so a trap set here would
# either be clobbered by the caller's own `trap cleanup EXIT` (leaking the
# ~120MB binary) or clobber it. The caller's cleanup must rm -rf "$CLI_BIN_DIR".
