# Indexes the session hand-overs in scripts/localonly/ and says which one is
# CANONICAL -- the one a session must read before doing anything else.
#
# Canonical is a DECISION, not a date. The newest hand-over is frequently not
# the one that governs: a session can close by writing a fresh hand-over that
# defers to an older one, and on 2026-08-19 that is exactly what happened
# (HANDOFF-2026-08-18-r1.md was superseded by -08-19-r1 while both stayed on
# disk). So this script never guesses by mtime. It reads the declaration out of
# the queue and REFUSES to answer when there is none.
#
# The contract, one line in scripts/localonly/QUEUE.md:
#
#     **Handoff CANONICAL: `HANDOFF-2026-08-26-r1.md`**
#
# Why a script and not a convention: 24 hand-overs accumulated, and which one
# governed lived in a sentence a human had to keep rewriting. It stopped being
# rewritten, sessions read a stale one, and a chain of branches sat unpushed for
# days because each session wrote its finding into a hand-over nobody actioned.
#
# The queue and the hand-overs are each developer's own, on their own machine:
# a developer who has none yet is not an error, and this says so and exits 0.
#
# Run: scripts/handoff-index.sh
# Exit: 0 ok, or no hand-overs yet · 1 hand-overs exist and no canonical is
#       declared, or it does not exist · 2 the pointer is stale (a hand-over is
#       newer than the canonical one).
