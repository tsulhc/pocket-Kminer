# Quantitative HA failover test.
#
# Question: after a mid-flight miner scale-down (2 replicas -> 1), does the
# total number of on-chain claimed relays equal the number of successful
# relays reported by the HTTP loader?
#
# The broader chaos tests answer "did the proof land?". This one answers
# "did we count every relay the loader thinks succeeded?". Any material
# drift flags either:
#   - relay loss during failover (survivor skipped stream entries), or
#   - WAL redelivery double-counting (dedup missed), or
#   - late-arriving relays rejected by the new leader (expected, bounded).
#
# Success criteria:
#   |ON_CHAIN_RELAYS - verified_ok| / verified_ok <= MAX_DRIFT_PCT/100
#
# Drift is bidirectional: either direction is noise at low %, a bug at high %.
#   - Under-count signals relay loss during failover (survivor skipped stream
#     entries) or WAL redelivery that dedup erroneously dropped.
#   - Over-count signals relays the relayer processed successfully but whose
#     HTTP response never reached the client (timeouts, connection drops -
#     NOT a supplier-side bug) OR genuine WAL double-counting from a dedup
#     miss (which IS a bug). At low %, it is overwhelmingly the former;
#     investigate if drift spikes.
#
# MAX_DRIFT_PCT defaults to 5%. Set MAX_DRIFT_PCT=0 for a strict run.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/test-quantitative-failover.sh
#   DURATION=120 HTTP_RPS=300 MAX_LOSS_PCT=2 ./scripts/test-quantitative-failover.sh
#   KILL_MODE=hard ./scripts/test-quantitative-failover.sh    # SIGKILL path — tests crash-before-checkpoint
#   KILL_MODE=graceful ./scripts/test-quantitative-failover.sh # default — SIGTERM + drain + final checkpoint
