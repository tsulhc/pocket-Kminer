# Test & Utility Scripts

Integration and load-test scripts that run against a live Tilt localnet.

**Checking a change is good is [`gates/`](gates/README.md)** — `make gate` runs
the same checks CI runs, in cost tiers. The scripts below are scenarios you
reach for deliberately; the gates are what every change passes.

**How to test is documented in [`../docs/testing/`](../docs/testing/README.md):**

- [`TILT.md`](../docs/testing/TILT.md) — bring the localnet up, port map, and the HA/chaos suite.
- [`DIRECT_CLI.md`](../docs/testing/DIRECT_CLI.md) — signed relays straight to the relayer via the `relay` CLI.

> **Scripts that drive the gateway (`:3069`) cannot tell you whether relays
> were mined.** The gateway answers a relayer `503` with `200` and an empty body, so a
> status-code check reports success either way — a real run showed
> `20000/20000 OK` with the WAL at `XLEN 0`. Where a script below sends traffic
> through the gateway, treat its success count as "the gateway replied", and confirm
> the outcome in Redis (`redis streams`, `redis submissions`) or with the CLI at
> `:8180`.

This file is just an inventory of what's here. All scripts assume the
`kind-kind` context and the localnet defaults (gateway `:3069`, relayer `:8180`,
Redis `:6379`, Prometheus `:9091`, Loki `:3100`). The `redis` subcommand's
`--redis` flag defaults to `redis://localhost:6379`, so it can be omitted.

## HA / chaos / resilience

| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `test-chaos.sh` | Chaos monkey: kills relayer/miner pods, blips Redis, injects backend latency/partitions/memory pressure. |
| `test-chaos-leader-flush-gap.sh` | Kills the miner leader in the claim-flush→proof gap; regression guard for SMST lazy-load on failover. |
| `test-quantitative-failover.sh` | Mid-flight miner scale-down; asserts on-chain claimed relays == loader successes within a drift budget. |
| `verify-rebalance-fix.sh` | Rebalancer veto regression (issue #7): both miner replicas must end with non-zero claimed_count. |

## Load / lifecycle

| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `test-continuous-load.sh` | Sustained signed load via the relay CLI at :8180 (override `--rps`) until Ctrl-C; reports Redis memory/session/stream growth for leak watching. |
| `test-stress-max.sh` | ~1000 RPS HTTP + 200 concurrent WebSocket for ~5 min; asserts claims/proofs via Loki. |

## Direct CLI / feature validation

| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `test-cache-cleanup-live.sh` | Level-3 validation of `redis cache --type all` cleanup under sustained CLI-driven load (direct to `:8180`, `--all-suppliers`). |
| `test-inclusion-reconciler.sh` | Verifies the block-driven inclusion reconciler; asserts on-chain inclusion via `redis submissions` + Prometheus/Loki. |

## Subdirectories

- `loadtest/` — backend RPS-ceiling measurement and per-service pool tuning (`backends.sh`). See [`loadtest/README.md`](loadtest/README.md).
- `ws-test/` — manual WebSocket tester through the gateway, reconnecting on session rollover (the CLI's `relay websocket --load-test` redials on its own).
- `lib/` — shared bash helpers (`cli-build.sh`: builds the relay CLI once for the scripts that drive the relayer at `:8180`).
- `observability/` — `triage.sh` evaluates the metric identities of [`../docs/METRICS_TRIAGE.md`](../docs/METRICS_TRIAGE.md) against Prometheus; `triage.conf.example` shows its settings.
- `localnet/` — localnet tooling: `gen-genesis.go` (regenerates the Tilt genesis and keys, sized for load), `check-cpu-limits.sh` (GOMAXPROCS equals each container's CPU limit).
- `hooks/` — the `pre-commit` and `pre-push` git hooks; install with `make install-hooks`.
- `localonly/` — gitignored; operator-specific config (see the operator-data rule in [`../CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md)).

## Repository and session tooling

| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `check-tracked-files.sh` | Fails when a file that must stay local (a working document, an ignored path) is tracked; `make check-tracked-files` and CI run it. |
| `handoff-index.sh` | Indexes your own session hand-overs in `localonly/` and says which one is canonical; exits 0 when you have none. |
| `queue-audit.sh` | Audits your own local work queue against the tree; exits 0 when you have none. |
| `session-start-check.sh` | Reports the machine's state at the start of a session. |
