# Audit the work queue against reality, so a DISCARDED item stops reading like a
# pending one.
#
# Why this exists (Jorge, 2026-08-31): "that's why I can't get the whole stack
# together -- because discarded items keep getting brought back to me." A session read the queue, reported
# issue #25 as open work, and it had been closed that same day -- along with #43,
# #7 and #8. The queue is the only durable record of what is pending, and nothing
# was checking it against the world, so every session re-litigated closed work and
# the stack never converged.
#
# It reports; it never edits. Exit 1 when something needs a human decision.
#
# The markers are English, and so must be the queue entries that carry them:
# evidence is a file:line, a backticked commit, "verified", "measured", or
# "Jorge's decision/request/ruling"; a settled entry says CLOSED, DISCARDED,
# DEFERRED, IGNORED, DEAD or NOT REPRODUCIBLE, in capitals.
