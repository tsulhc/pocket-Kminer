# Chaos Monkey for pocket-relay-miner
#
# Runs alongside the stress test and randomly injects failures:
#   1. Kill random relayer/miner pods (test HA failover)
#   2. Redis connection blip (test fail-open/closed behavior)
#   3. Redis latency marker (test pool behaviour under slow commands)
#   4. Kill a backend pod (test circuit breaker + health-check recovery)
#   5. Connection flood against the relayer (test pool exhaustion)
#   6. Pull and restore a supplier signing key (test the no_local_signer gate)
#
# Usage:
#   # In terminal 1: run stress test
#   ./scripts/test-stress-max.sh
#
#   # In terminal 2: run chaos monkey alongside
#   ./scripts/test-chaos.sh
#
#   # Or run both together:
#   ./scripts/test-stress-max.sh &
#   ./scripts/test-chaos.sh
