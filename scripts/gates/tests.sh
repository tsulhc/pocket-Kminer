# The `test` build tag is not optional: test-only helpers are behind it, and
# without the tag the suite compiles into a different, smaller program than the
# one this repository means by "the tests".
#
# The cache, miner and relayer packages run sequentially when targeted on their
# own: their tests mutate process-wide state in place, so concurrent tests would
# read each other's writes. The flags are not the guard -- they do not apply to
# the whole-tree run -- TestNoTestParallelWhereStateIsShared in
# internal/conventions is. gate_parallelism in lib.sh holds the full reasoning.
# This mirrors `make test`; keep the two in step.

# container reused across the whole run, on its own port, never the localnet's.
# Captured first and evaluated second, deliberately: the exit status of
# `eval "$(cmd)"` is the status of the string it evaluates, not of cmd, so a
# failing redis.sh would be swallowed and the run would collapse into a wall of
# per-test fatals instead of one diagnostic.
