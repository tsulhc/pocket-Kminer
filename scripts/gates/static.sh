# Gate: static checks. Seconds, no cluster, no network.
#
#   gofmt -s · go build · go vet · golangci-lint · tracked-file guard · Spanish text
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/gates/static.sh              # whole tree, both Go modules
#   scripts/gates/static.sh --staged     # gofmt only what this commit stages
#   PKG=miner scripts/gates/static.sh    # narrow build/vet to one package
#
# --staged exists for the pre-commit hook: formatting is judged on the files the
# commit actually contains, while build/vet/lint stay whole-tree because a
# package cannot be compiled in isolation from the change that breaks it.
#
# This repository has TWO Go modules -- the root and tilt/backend-server -- and
# `go build ./...` in the root does not reach the second one. Both are checked
# here, matching what `make lint` and `make fmt` already do.
