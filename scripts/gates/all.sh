# Run the repository's gates, in order, up to a level.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/gates/all.sh                  # level 2 (the default: everything
#                                         #  that runs without a cluster)
#   scripts/gates/all.sh --level 1        # static only -- seconds
#   scripts/gates/all.sh --level 3        # + live validation on Tilt
#   scripts/gates/all.sh --keep-going     # run every gate even after a failure
#   PKG=miner scripts/gates/all.sh        # narrow to one package
#
# Levels are cost tiers, not importance tiers:
#
#   1  static     seconds        gofmt, build, vet, lint, tracked files
#   2  tests      minutes        test suite, race detector, coverage
#   3  live       tens of min.   relays mined and settled on-chain, on Tilt
#
# Fail-fast by default, because the levels are ordered by dependency as well as
# cost: a tree that does not build cannot produce a meaningful test result, so
# running level 2 after a level 1 failure buys noise. --keep-going when you want
# the full picture in one pass.
