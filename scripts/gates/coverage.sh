# This is what CI actually rejects on (.github/workflows/ci.yml runs both
# `make test` and `make test-coverage`), and it is NOT the same run as
# scripts/gates/tests.sh: instrumenting for coverage widens timing, which
# surfaces flakes a plain `go test` never shows. Passing tests.sh and failing
# here is a normal outcome, not a contradiction -- run this before any push.
#
# coverage.out is a build artifact and is written to the working tree. That is
# the one deliberate exception to "a gate has no side effects", because the
# profile is the point of the run; it is gitignored.
