# Gate: the race detector. Minutes, no cluster.
#
#   go test -tags test -race -count=1 ./...
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/gates/race.sh             # whole tree
#   PKG=miner scripts/gates/race.sh   # one package
#
# CONTRIBUTING.md calls this Rule #1 and says it cannot be broken. Until this gate
# existed the only target that passed -race was `test_miner`, covering
# ./miner/... alone, and CI invoked neither -- the rule was declared and never
# executed.
#
# -count=1 disables the test result cache. A cached PASS from a run without
# -race would satisfy the command while proving nothing about races.
#
# A race detector finding is never "flaky". The detector reports a race it
# observed; not observing one on the next run means the schedule differed, not
# that the race is gone. Re-running until green is how a race reaches
# production.

# container reused across the whole run, on its own port, never the localnet's.
# Captured first and evaluated second, deliberately: the exit status of
# `eval "$(cmd)"` is the status of the string it evaluates, not of cmd, so a
# failing redis.sh would be swallowed and the run would collapse into a wall of
# per-test fatals instead of one diagnostic.

    # The `---` is anchored to FAIL. Bare, it also matches `--- PASS`, and since
    # `-json` implies verbose those are always present: measured on the red run
    # of 2026-09-09, the old pattern matched 2349 lines and the FIRST 40 -- all
    # gate_detail keeps -- were 40 of 40 `--- PASS`. The operator read a wall of
    # green out of a gate that had just failed. Anchored, the same log prints 6.
    #
    # `DATA RACE` stays loose and must not be folded into the FAIL alternative:
    # a race in a goroutine outliving its test can leave every test `--- PASS`,
    # which is the case this gate exists for (reported by the council, not
    # measured here).

    # -B1 because the line saying WHY printed just above its `--- FAIL`:
    # in that same log the anchor gave `--- FAIL: TestQueuedCaller...` and the
    # preceding `tx_permits_test.go:146: the queued caller never returned`.
    # -B1 takes whatever precedes a match, so a `FAIL` line whose predecessor is
    # green yields a `--- PASS` in the output, and grep inserts its own `--`
    # between non-adjacent groups: on that log, 1 of the 6 lines is each. Both
    # are expected; the defect this replaced was 40 of 40 green.

    # PASSING test -- 15 such lines that day, 14 of them from tests that did not
    # fail -- a count bounded by how much the tree logs, not by the failure, so
    # it re-creates this same defect once the tree logs enough.
