# Gate: live validation on the Tilt localnet. Tens of minutes, needs a cluster.
#
# Proves the money path end to end: relays are served and signed, the miner
# consumes them off the WAL, and the resulting claim -- and its proof, when one
# is required -- are INCLUDED ON-CHAIN. Nothing below infers success from a
# Redis key or an HTTP status.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/gates/live.sh                     # verify, load, wait, assert
#   scripts/gates/live.sh --preflight-only    # check readiness and stop
#   scripts/gates/live.sh --relays 600 --concurrency 10
#   scripts/gates/live.sh --service develop-grpc
#
# This gate NEVER starts or stops anything. If the localnet is not up it says
# what to run and exits non-zero. Bringing the cluster up takes ports and
# containers that another session on this machine may be using, so that
# decision stays with the person at the keyboard.
#
# Three things that will otherwise waste an afternoon, all learned the hard way:
#
#   * Load goes through the relay CLI at :8180, NEVER the gateway. The gateway
#     answers a relayer 503 with 200 and an empty body, so a gateway-side run
#     reports 20000/20000 OK with an empty WAL.
#   * There is an economic cap of roughly 115-130 mined relays per supplier per
#     session (~109s). Past it the relayer correctly returns 429 and only the
#     first session claims, which looks like a broken pipeline and is not. The
#     defaults here stay under it; --all-suppliers spreads the rest.
#   * Tilt's port-forward is sometimes IPv6-only. curl to localhost still works
#     while the Go CLI fails with "connect: connection refused" and the load
#     test reports 0%. Detected in preflight and worked around.

# UNORDERED-NONCE COLLISIONS. A cosmos-sdk unordered tx is keyed by

# used to carry the same nonce and all but one were rejected. Measured live
# 2026-09-03: three sessions in claim_tx_error, one EXPIRED claim, one slashing
# event.
#
# The gate already fails on claim_tx_error, but that is the SYMPTOM: it says a
# session failed, not why, and it fires just as readily for a dozen unrelated
# causes. This reads the cause.
#
# It reads the METRIC and not the log on purpose. The log line is a Warn on a
# per-request path, which this repo's logging policy may legitimately demote to
# Debug -- a grep would then pass in silence. And matching the RawLog text would
# be the substring classification the tx layer is being rewritten to remove.
#
# codespace+code, not text: code 18 in codespace "sdk" is ErrInvalidRequest,
# which for OUR transactions means a reused unordered nonce or "ttl exceeds
# 10m0s" -- both our own defect, so the pair is the right granularity here. A
# deadline already passed is NOT in this bucket: it is rejected seven decorators
# earlier, under code 30 when the timeout HEIGHT passed and code 42 when the
# timeout TIMESTAMP did. See tx/metrics.go for why, and for the version caveat.
#
# NEITHER OF THOSE TWO IS COUNTED BY ANY CHECK IN THIS FILE. The 30 in
# particular only became reachable once the client started setting a timeout
# height, and it means a claim or proof window closed before the node saw the
# transaction -- lost work, which is precisely what a live gate ought to see.
# Extending this check is a decision of its own and is recorded in the queue;
# it is named here so the absence is not read as coverage.
#
# THE FAMILY IS ha_tx_*, NOT ha_miner_*. The tx package registers with
# namespace "ha" and subsystem "tx", and MinerFactory adds no prefix of its own.
# The first version of this check queried ha_miner_tx_*, which does not exist --
# and a query for a series that does not exist returns ZERO, so the check read
# "no collisions" forever and could never go red. Level 2 does not run this
# file, so nothing caught it.

#
# Its limit, stated rather than hidden: it still does not PROVE two txs shared a

# reaches the chain -- it now carries a timeout_height, that height is derived

# a failed resend, and a missing claim is re-sent on every block its window
# allows. Measured 2026-09-09: this gate observed NONE of them. The three
# metrics they emit had ZERO readers here, and code=30 and code=19 were unread
# because the only rejection query filters code="18". A run would have gone
# green without touching a line of it.
#
# READ THREE STATES, NEVER ONE. Every other Prometheus read in this file ends in
# `// "0"` with a `|| echo 0` behind it, so ABSENT, GENUINELY-ZERO, BAD-JSON and
# PROMETHEUS-DOWN all arrive as the same 0. Those three sites are each protected
# by a positive control downstream (the >=3 broadcast floor, and the
# published-series guard), so they are not defects today -- but this block adds
# assertions whose healthy value IS zero, and a zero that cannot be told from a
# dead instrument is exactly the false green the nonce check documents above.

# assert_timeout_regime_per_phase asserts that each phase's broadcasts follow

# gate's own assertion is exercised the same way any other test is: pulled out
# as its own function, not inlined, so a harness can extract it with sed and
# run it against fabricated inputs -- never copied, since a copy drifts from
# the original and the harness would then prove something that no longer
# exists.
#
# Claim and proof measure DIFFERENT windows -- the widths lifecycle_callback.go
# feeds to tx.WindowTimeout for each phase, one derived through
# GetClaimWindowOpenHeight/GetClaimWindowCloseHeight and their proof-window
# counterparts in poktroll's x/shared/types (exact offsets and the module
# version this was checked against are in the commit, not repeated here where
# they would rot the moment either side moves).
#
# The regime is counted where a transaction is SIGNED (tx), labeled by its type,
# so a resend that signs is checked under its own phase -- it inherits the
# original's budget from the rebroadcast entry -- and a re-injection of bytes
# already signed counts nothing. There is no equality with broadcasts: those
# count accepted sends, fresh or re-injected, and a signed transaction may be
# refused, so the two differ legitimately (measured 2026-09-23: 1384 regimes,
# 1304 broadcasts, the gap being 80 re-injections answered "already in the
# mempool"). A path that signs without deriving a deadline is what this gate

# resent (normal), or nobody wired the counter (a regression that would go
# silent forever). They are told apart by asking the BINARY UNDER TEST, not
# Prometheus: the metric name is compiled in whether or not it ever fires. So a
# missing name is a FAILURE and a missing series is a note.

# --- Settlement breakdown -----------------------------------------------------
#
# Reporting only. Nothing here fails the gate, and that is deliberate: the two
# loss channels below are EXPECTED to read zero on a healthy localnet, so a
# non-zero would be the finding while a zero proves nothing. Printing them keeps
# "did not occur" and "was never looked at" from producing the same signal.
#
# The numbers are already on disk. scan_settlement_events captures every
# attribute of every pocket.tokenomics.Event, so the settlement breakdown has
# been collected on every run since that function existed -- only num_relays was
# ever read out of it.
#
# THREE relay counts exist and they are not interchangeable:
#
#   sent (the CLI's count)   relays served, BEFORE the relayer's difficulty filter
#   num_relays               leaves in the submitted tree, i.e. only the relays
#                            whose hash matched the service's mining difficulty
#   num_estimated_relays     num_relays x the difficulty multiplier, the chain's
#                            estimate of the work actually done
#
# The gate's billing assertion compares sent against num_relays, which spans the
# difficulty filter and is therefore only sound at BASE difficulty. Localnet runs
# there (every service reports an unset target hash, which x/service resolves to
# BaseRelayDifficultyHashBz, multiplier 1), so the two coincide and the assertion
# holds. On a network with real difficulty it would not. Both are printed so the
# day they diverge is visible rather than inferred.
