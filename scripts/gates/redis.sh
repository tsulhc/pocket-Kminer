# miniredis is not Redis where the interesting behaviour lives -- it answers a
# blocking XREADGROUP immediately, does not age PEL entries, and approximates
# expiry -- and this repository has already paid for that gap with a consumer
# that could not be shut down while the whole suite stayed green.
#
# Deliberately NOT the localnet's Redis. Locally that is the running Tilt fleet
# holding live relay traffic, so tests would compete with the thing they are
# meant to measure, on a port a stray FLUSHALL could ruin. This starts its own
# container on its own port instead.
#
# One SHARED container for the whole run, not one per package: `go test ./...` runs
# package binaries in parallel, and a container per binary is how the first attempt
# at this timed out -- that was 24 CONTAINERS, not 24 reapers: testcontainers starts
# a single Ryuk per run (it groups by a hash of the parent PID), measured live on
# 2026-09-18.
#
# The exception is the handful of tests that change SERVER-wide config (`maxmemory`,
# `maxmemory-policy`), which prefix isolation cannot contain: each asks for its own
# with `testredis.Exclusive(t)` -- one container per TEST on an ephemeral port. See
# `internal/testredis/exclusive.go`.
