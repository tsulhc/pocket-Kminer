# Shared plumbing for the repository's quality gates.
#
# Source this, do not execute it. Every gate under scripts/gates/ reports
# through these helpers so that a human, CI and an agent all read the same
# output and can rely on the same contract:
#
#   * exit 0 means the gate passed, non-zero means it failed;
#   * the LAST line is the verdict, so a caller that keeps only the tail still
#     learns the outcome;
#   * a gate REPORTS, it never FIXES. A gate that rewrites files hides the
#     failure it just found, and in a pre-commit context it rewrites the tree
#     after git has already snapshotted the index.
#   * a gate has no side effects: it does not touch git, the index, or the
#     working tree.
#
# A missing tool is a SKIP, not a pass. "I found nothing" and "I did not look"
# must never produce the same signal, so a skip is printed loudly and, unlike a
# pass, is counted and reported in the verdict.

# Colour only when a terminal is going to read it. CI logs and piped output get
# plain text, which keeps grep and log viewers honest.

# CURRENT SHELL. A helper function invoked via command substitution --
# anything called as `x="$(some_helper ...)"` -- runs in a SUBSHELL, and a
# gate_fail called from inside it increments a copy of $gate_failed that dies
# with the subshell. gate_verdict, back in the real shell, never sees it: the
# gate prints PASS and the failure is gone with no error, no trace.
#
# A helper that needs to fail must instead `return` non-zero and let the
# CALLER (which is not inside a subshell) check that and call gate_fail
# itself. gate_settlement_breakdown is the worked example: it returns 1 on a
# jq parse failure, and live.sh checks that exit status (captured via
# `x="$(...)"; rc=$?` BEFORE the value is consumed by anything else, since
# `read var <<<"$(...)"` throws the substitution's exit status away in favor
# of read's own) before calling gate_fail itself (review 2026-08-20, found
# while fixing exactly this in gate_settlement_breakdown).
#
# The pure helpers here today (gate_unexplained_shortfall, gate_served_

# that MEASURES something and is therefore invoked as `x="$(helper ...)"` cannot
# report through them: it would increment a copy that dies with the subshell. A

# The default is the safe one: a gate that never calls this leaves the file empty,

# good result. Measured in budgetkit 2026-08-26: one screen printed DATA RACE=0,

# read as a clean zero -- indistinguishable from "this did not happen".
#
# relays and estimated are NOT the same quantity and must not be summed
# together: relays counts the leaves in the submitted tree, i.e. only the relays
# whose hash matched the service's mining difficulty, while estimated is that
# count scaled back up by the difficulty multiplier. They coincide only at base
# difficulty.
#
# EventApplicationOverserviced is filtered by the same min-session-end-height
# window as EventClaimSettled -- an events file spans the whole scan range a
# caller handed to scan_settlement_events, not just this run's load window,
# so an unfiltered $over would let a stale overservicing event from a
# PREVIOUS run report as "overservicing occurred" for this one (review

# $(...) to capture the TSV, and a command substitution runs in a subshell,
# so a gate_failed increment made in here would vanish when the subshell
# exits (review 2026-08-20, MEDIUM). The empty-events-file case above is
# NOT an error and stays a silent, correct zero; jq actually failing IS

#
# The miner testify suites add a third: SetupTest clears the whole SUITE-WIDE
# key prefix, so a sibling test running at the same time loses its keys.

# These flags are NOT the guard, and must not be read as one. They only apply

# a session to settle -- or an empty string if any input is not a positive
# integer (same validation as gate_expected_timeout_regime, and for the same
# reason: an un-numeric argument reaching bash arithmetic silently resolves to
# 0 instead of erroring). Worst case: a session that has JUST started must
# first run its full length (SESSION_BLOCKS), then wait out the claim window
# (CLAIM_OPEN + CLAIM_CLOSE blocks after session end) and the proof window
# that follows it (PROOF_OPEN + PROOF_CLOSE more) before an EndBlocker settles
# it. A fixed default in minutes was only ever right at the clock it was
# written against; the number MUST MOVE WITH THE CLOCK. 50% headroom on top
# of the worst case absorbs poll granularity and the occasional slow block
# without hard-coding a second clock-specific number.

# gate_spanish_hits <repo dir> <words file> [--cached]
#
# Prints every line of a TRACKED file in <repo dir> that carries Spanish, as
# `path:line:text`. Two levels, because accents alone miss most of it: measured
# on c1cc164^, 11 of the 25 files that commit translated had no accented letter.
#   * the accented vowels, the tilde n and the two inverted marks, written as an
#     ALTERNATION of whole characters, never a bracket class: a class is a list
#     of BYTES outside a UTF-8 locale, so under LC_ALL=C it matched the lead byte
#     of the multiplication sign and flagged 66 files (measured); the alternation
#     matches the same 0 in both locales. The characters are spelled as UTF-8
#     octal bytes so this file carries none of them and is scanned like any other;
#   * the whole words of <words file> (`-w`, case-insensitive). Without `-w` a
#     short Spanish word matches inside ordinary English ones.
#
# `git grep` scans tracked files only, by construction, and `-I` skips binaries.
# The words file itself is excluded by pathspec -- it is the only exclusion, and
# every line of it is a Spanish word. --cached reads the index instead of the
# working tree, which is what the pre-commit hook is about to commit.
#
# Returns 0 when nothing matched, 1 when something did, and 2 when it could not
# look: an unreadable or malformed word list, a git error, or ZERO tracked files
# to scan -- a broken matcher, not a clean tree. Like every helper here it never
# calls gate_fail; the caller does, on the status.
