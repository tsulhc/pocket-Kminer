// The classifiers are exercised through the REAL client, and that is the whole
// point of this file.
//
// The test that motivated it lived in the reconciler and built a *TxRejection by
// hand with ABCICode 19 and codespace "sdk". Its assertion was true -- a resend
// handed that sentinel does not spend an attempt -- but nothing in it ever
// reached the function that DECIDES whether a 19 becomes that sentinel. Measured:
// making isAlreadyQueuedRejection return false unconditionally left every test in
// ./tx/ and ./miner/ green. A test that constructs its own input proves what the
// code does WITH it, never that the system produces it.
//
// So here the rejection comes from a broadcast that actually fails, and the
// assertion is errors.Is on what the client returns.
//
// THE PAIR IS THE KEY, NOT THE NUMBER. ABCI codes are registered per codespace,
// so a 19 or a 30 arriving from another module means something unrelated -- both
// sentinels say so in their own comments, and until this file existed nothing
// held them to it: dropping the codespace check from either classifier changed
// no test's colour.
