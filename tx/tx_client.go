// -- and reusing that pair is rejected in CheckTx with "sender %s has already
// used timeout %d". The anchor is the chain's latest_block_time, which does not
// move inside a block. Measured live 2026-09-03: three sessions in
// claim_tx_error, one EXPIRED claim (8 relays, PROOF_MISSING) and one slashing
// event, with relays lost on EVERY transport -- which is what places the cause
// here rather than in one transport's path.
//
// It only has to separate transactions inside ONE block. The duration added to
// the anchor is constant for a whole window -- WindowTimeout takes the window's
// full length, not the blocks left in it, and a resend reuses the budget stored
// with its original (the ceiling, if an older binary stripped it) -- so
// anchor+timeout moves with the anchor, and the chain
// only accepts a block whose time is strictly after the previous one. Two
// transactions of one window built against different latest blocks are
// therefore apart by the interval between those blocks. What collides is
// several built against the SAME latest block: two session-end groups, the
// retry loop, a rebroadcast landing beside a retry.
//
// A retry in a LATER block used to recompute its original's nonce, when the
// duration was the blocks left and shrank as the anchor advanced. That went
// with the arithmetic. NOT MEASURED: a claim and a proof can carry different
// window lengths, and could then still meet across blocks if the real block
// interval matched that difference to the nanosecond.
//
// WHY ADDING IS SAFE, AND SUBTRACTING IS NOT. The ante handler makes three
// checks and an offset that only moves the timestamp LATER can trip none of
// them: it cannot make the deadline look already-passed. Never subtract. The
