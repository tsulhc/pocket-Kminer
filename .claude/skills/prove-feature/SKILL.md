# prove-feature

**The question this answers, and it is the same question in budgetkit:**

> Do the tests and the live matrix actually EXERCISE the feature being declared
> complete, measured against the acceptance criteria written BEFORE the work?

Not "do the tests pass" — that is `gates`. Not "does this one test bite" — that
is `test-teeth`. This asks whether the thing you are about to call finished is
*observed anywhere*.

**This runs FIRST in a feature's review, before any refuting.** Refuting an
uncovered feature is refuting a description of it.

## Why this exists here, and it is the most expensive kind of green

A key-handling branch shipped a regression that **L3 passed over twice**: the
miner ran with its signing-key hot reload silently OFF. The gate measures relays
served and relays billed, and both were exact — it never touches the reload path.
Nothing was broken in what the gate observes, so nothing went red, twice.

The same shape, counted: **44 of the 45 error and loss metrics are read by no
gate at all** — `upokt_lost_total`, `compute_units_lost_total`,
`relays_lost_total`, `relays_failed_smst_total` among them. Only
`ha_miner_relays_rejected_total` is asserted anywhere. A metric nothing reads is
an observer that was built and never wired.

## The loop

1. **Read the acceptance criteria as written BEFORE the work.** `item` step 1 is
   where they were recorded. If none were written, stop: the feature has nothing
   to be measured against, and that is the finding. A criterion invented now gets
   shaped to what was built.
2. **Map each criterion to something that OBSERVES it** — a cell of the L3
   MATRIX, a script under `scripts/`, or a test whose assertion names it. One
   criterion with no observer is a gap; write it down rather than arguing it is
   implied.
3. **For each observer, ask whether it would go RED with the feature broken.** Do
   not reason about it — that is `test-teeth`, pointed at the live step. A check
   that stays green with the feature reverted is decoration.
4. **Missing steps are ADDED AND RUN. The feature is not done until they are.**
   This is the part that gets skipped, because at this point everything is green
   and adding a step feels like inventing work.
5. **Report the verdict as COVERAGE, never as confidence**: which criteria are
   observed, by what, and which are not. "It all works" is not a verdict.

## Which transport, which mode — naming the cells that did NOT run

For a feature the question is only WHICH live cells land, never *whether*. The
matrix has ten staked services across five transports, and a feature can be
exercised on one and untouched on the rest.

The model, from the signing-key work: L3 passed on `keyring`/`test` and the
hand-over said, in those words, that `keyring`/`file` and `keys_file` were **not
run**. That sentence is the deliverable of this step. An unwritten judgement is
indistinguishable from never having asked.

## The mutation rule, pointed at the live gate

An observer can be present and still prove nothing. The three ways a mutation
lies — the tautology, the one that reddens by crashing, and the check that never
reaches the fix — apply to a live assertion as much as to a unit test. Measured
2026-08-26: `live.sh` asserted served == billed for ten services and reported
**zero units exercised**, because nothing was counting what it had measured. The
assertions were real; the coverage claim was not.

`test-teeth` holds those three; load it when a step's teeth are in doubt rather
than diagnosing from memory.

## What a gap earns

- **The feature is not done.** Add the observer, run it, then declare.
- **If it genuinely cannot be observed live**, say which tests pin the behaviour
  instead, in writing, naming them — and say which transport and which mode were
  not covered.
- **If the criterion turned out to be wrong**, fix the criterion and say that you
  did, never silently after seeing what got built.

## The coverage verdict is itself audited, or it is a prediction in a table

The rows of a coverage table are written fast, from memory of what the tests are
called. **A row filled in by READING is a prediction wearing the format of a
measurement** -- and it lands in the one artifact whose entire job is to say what
was measured, so it contaminates the only thing separating measured from assumed.

Measured 2026-09-07, by the author against his own table. A criterion -- "nothing
resends inside the safety margin" -- was credited to the test whose NAME matched
it. That test seeds an entry without the field the new code keys on, so it never
exercises the new mechanism at all: it covers the guard as it stood BEFORE the
feature. The risk the criterion now names was introduced by the feature itself,
and the test that actually covers it was a different one, credited to a different
row.

The check that catches this, and it is cheap: for each row, ask **which property
of that observer does the work**, and whether the observer touches the code path
the feature ADDED. A test that predates the feature can only cover the criterion
as it was before -- if the feature changed what the criterion is exposed to, a
pre-existing test is evidence about the old shape.

## The one-line test for whether this ran

The report lists every acceptance criterion with the observer that exercises it,
and every criterion with none. It is stated as **coverage, never as confidence**:
"it all works" is not a verdict, and a criterion whose observer would not go red
with the feature broken is listed as uncovered, not as covered.
