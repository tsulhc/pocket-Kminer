# Item

One unit of work, start to finish. The steps are the same in both products; what
each step DOES differs where the products differ.

## The three that govern every item

1. **The success criterion is written before the work**, and it is checkable.
   `CLAUDE.md` requires it; "it works" is not one.

   **"This one is mechanical" is not an exemption — it is the case that needs it
   MOST.** Measured 2026-08-27: the criterion was written for a small gate change
   (three checks, all met) and skipped for a branch cascade, on the grounds that
   a rebase is mechanical. The script then took the wrong fork point, replayed
   ZERO commits onto each new base, and **collapsed seven branches and pushed
   them broken**. The criterion that would have caught it on the FIRST link is
   one line — "each branch keeps the N commits it contributed" — and it is
   exactly the `N de N` guard that had to be written afterwards, at the cost of
   a restore. Automation does not make a missing criterion cheaper; it repeats
   the mistake once per item.

   Jorge, same day, on being asked what he had to repeat: *"just the karpathy
   thing, which I keep having to remind you of"*. It had already been the finding of
   2026-08-25. A rule that fires only when someone remembers it is not a rule,
   which is why it is step one here and not advice.
2. **A finding is not recorded until it is proposed to the maintainer** (the
   hand-over's "Proposed findings" section) with two questions: add it to
   `scripts/localonly/QUEUE.md` or not, open an issue or not. Nothing is queued or
   filed without his answer.
3. **The work ends at asking for push and PR**, not at the hand-over. See
   `close-session`.

## Rule #1 — print the working list, in the reply, before anything else

The steps you are about to run, named. A list you did not print is a list you
will drift from, and the drift is invisible to the person reading the reply.

## Step 1 — size it against the tree, and distrust the plan that describes it

Read the code the item names before believing anything written about it. A plan
is a prediction: measured 2026-08-20, **two of two tests written inside a plan
were broken when finally run** — one asserted a counter that path never
increments, the other compared two different arguments. The plan's "Expected:
FAIL" had never been executed.

If the item came from a review or an issue, re-derive the claim from the code.
Somebody else's finding is a claim until you reproduce it.

### WALK ONE CONCRETE CASE, AND REPRODUCE IT, BEFORE SIZING OR CHOOSING

Jorge, 2026-09-03: *"we should always walk the example, to understand what and where
it is happening, reproduce it — that gives us understanding and perspective; only
that way do we see what is being attempted and look for the best solution."*

Not "read the code": take ONE operator, ONE file, ONE request, and follow it hop by
hop to the consequence — then RUN it. A probe, a failing test, a bare container. The
reproduction is what turns a claim into a thing you can see.

**"It is small" is a conclusion, and it needs measuring like any other.** Reading
sizes the SYMPTOM; walking sizes the DEFECT, and they are routinely different by an
order of magnitude. Three times in one session, 2026-09-02/03:

- An inherited item said two keys collide and money is lost. Walked with a probe:
  valid keys never collide, the trigger is ~1 in 10^39, and the outcome is
  fail-closed. It was correctly SHRUNK, and the owner dropped it.
- The same item's sibling was reported as "a misleading label, about three lines".
  Walking one corrupt `.info` through both branches found TWO CONTRADICTORY POLICIES,
  each written down and justified in the repo, one of which BLOCKED KEY WITHDRAWALS
  — money. The three-line reading was the symptom.
- A release fix looked provable against the gate's Redis. Running it against the
  version the cluster actually runs showed the test would have passed without ever
  reaching the line the fix changed.

**It also fixes the council.** The council reads the space of approaches, and that
space is only as good as the question. A question written from a symptom sends four
members to deliberate where the defect is not — the failure this skill already warns
about under "the question must carry the STRUCTURE". Walking the case IS how the
structure is obtained.

So the order is: walk one case → reproduce it → size it → only then invoke the
council. And if the walk cannot be done, say so and say why; that is a finding about
the item, not a licence to skip to the fix.

## Step 1c — list the assertions that already govern what you are about to change

Before touching it, name the tests, guards and gates that already hold that code,
and say which of them SHOULD go red. Anything you change that no assertion covers
is a gap you are creating knowingly.

Measured 2026-08-26: `gate_exercised` was added to one of `static.sh`'s two
modes. Nothing was asserting the other mode, so nothing failed, and the gate's
contract silently depended on which mode ran.

## Step 2 — do it, under the process the repo already demands

Conventions are tests here (`internal/conventions`), so a violation fails rather
than waits for review. Do not add a knob where a KeyBuilder method belongs, do
not add a bare `go` statement, do not reach for `sync.Map`.

### Choosing the approach — THE COUNCIL RUNS FIRST, on every item

**Invoke the council before the first edit of ANY issue or feature.** Not when the
space looks wide, not when the fix looks hard, not only for product code — every
item. Jorge, 2026-08-29, after a session skipped it: *"I clearly instructed you to
use the council for any fix — why? Simple: so the solution is the best one, not
the first one that occurred to you, so they make you doubt, rethink the
case."* And the reasoning behind it, his words: *"2 think better than 1, and 3
better than 2; sometimes it's noise, but from the filtered noise come other
important points that help arrive at the best solution."*

**The council is not the review.** A review reads code you already wrote; the
council reads the SPACE OF APPROACHES before you pick one. They do not substitute
for each other, and running three rounds of review afterwards does not pay back a
council that never ran.

This step exists because of this repository's most expensive measured failure: the
signing key classification took FOUR commits — `efd2fb8` → `fb46b85` → `47116f8`
→ `2ce1d30` — and the last one reintroduced the exact failure mode the previous
one had just fixed, leaving a reload abandoned forever while a pulled key kept
signing. **It recurred on 2026-08-29, worse**, in `scripts/gates/live.sh`: five
defensible fixes existed for one defect, the session chose one from a single
paragraph of its own reasoning — reading the old "invoke it when the space is
wide" bullet as permission to skip — and it cost ELEVEN commits on one file, a
level-3 run in RED, and a correction that reintroduced what the previous one had
just fixed. That bullet is gone; this paragraph replaced it.

**And the trap that made skipping feel safe:** a measurement that proves the
PROBLEM does not authorise the FIX. That session had measured, correctly, that an
instant Prometheus query loses a dead pod's series — and took the confidence from
that measurement into choosing a fix it had not tested against three of the four
consumers that read the value.

- **Size it before spending it**, always: say roughly how many members and how
  many tokens, in the same message that proposes it. A fan-out nobody sized is
  the failure Jorge has to catch.
- **It finds STRUCTURAL defects, the kind visible by reading** — a system that
  agrees with its own error. It does not find behavioural ones that only appear
  when you run the thing.
- **Launch members WITHOUT a `name:`.** Naming a subagent makes it an addressable
  peer and its result stops coming back: 4 of 4 mute named, complete unnamed
  (budgetkit, 2026-08-26).
- **The question must carry the STRUCTURE**, with verified `file:line`. Asked
  about the symptom, it deliberates where the defect is not, and that mistake
  costs the whole budget.
- **Propose the cost before spending it** — roughly 800k tokens for four members.
  Jorge's standing rule: a fan-out nobody sized is the failure he has to catch.
- **Its output is a CLAIM, not a finding.** It does not enter the queue without a
  command that reproduces it: the members are all the same model, so agreement
  between them is not corroboration.

### Before the commit — get the WRITING evaluated, not just the approach

The council reads the space of approaches BEFORE you pick one. Nothing in this
skill used to read what you actually WROTE before it landed, and that gap has a
measured shape: **the code was right and the prose around it overclaimed, three
times in one session** (2026-08-31, `keys/keyring_provider.go`). Each round of
review found that the comment written to explain the PREVIOUS fix asserted more
than had been measured:

- "two causes that are byte-identical from here" — they were only
  indistinguishable because the code did not look; the dependency offered a
  discriminator that was never tried.
- a commit message reading "releasing every supplier must never be silent",
  written in the commit that left the MAXIMAL form of that event silent. Measured
  after the fact: the counter did not move.
- a clamp comment reasoning only about removals, when an addition in the same
  window produces the same reading.

Jorge, that day: *"that happens to you because you don't review what you're about
to write; you go write it or make the fix without consulting someone who
evaluates YOU."* The council
evaluates the PLAN. Nothing was evaluating the author.

So, before `git commit`, and on the diff you are about to commit:

1. **Read every claim you wrote as if someone else wrote it.** Comments, commit
   message, doc edits. Mark each sentence that asserts a property of the world:
   "cannot", "never", "must", "identical", "the only", "no readers", "always".
2. **For each one, point at the measurement or mark it.** A command you ran, a
   test that goes red without it, a line of the dependency's source. If you
   cannot, write "not verified" — `CLAUDE.md` already requires this of durable
   artifacts, and a comment and a commit message are both durable. The rule
   existed and did not fire, because nothing made it fire HERE.
3. **Then get it evaluated by something that is not you** — `/code-review` on the
   staged diff, or a subagent asked to attack the claims specifically. Afterwards
   is not the same: a review that runs post-commit turns a claim you could have
   deleted into history someone has to correct.

**And the failure one level below overclaiming: a measurement you ran, read for
its RESULT and not its CONSEQUENCE.** Measured 2026-08-31, same session, and it
cost the HIGH that all three review rounds were about. A probe printed that a
corrupt record under `key_names` comes back as an ERROR rather than being
silently skipped. That was read as "so this branch already catches corruption,
and needs no guard" — correct, and the wrong conclusion. Being caught meant the
provider returned an error, which meant `manager.Reload` abandoned the reload and
kept the previous key set, which meant a key withdrawn afterwards kept signing
forever: the exact defect the session was fixing, still alive in the branch its
own measurement had just visited. The probe was right. The sentence after it was
not.

So for every measurement used as evidence FOR a decision, write the next hop:
not "X returns an error" but "X returns an error, which its caller turns into Y,
which for the operator means Z". The measurement ends at the value; the claim
does not.

The cheap tell that this step is being skipped: the diff explains WHY at length
and the reply says the change is small. Length of justification is not evidence,
and it is where the overclaiming lives.

## Step 3 — prove the test can fail

Use `test-teeth`. Do not restate it here.

## Step 4 — sweep what the change made stale

Every document that asserted the old state is now wrong, and nobody will notice.
Measured 2026-08-26: the auto-loaded memory index named a hand-over that had
stopped being canonical, in two places, and a queue entry said "NOT DONE" about
something another session had already closed. Grep for the thing you changed,
not for the file you remember.

## Step 5 — the gates, bare

**Bring your own test Redis DOWN first (`scripts/gates/redis.sh down`).** The gate
starts its own on the same port with the same name, and one you left running from
a targeted test run collides with it. What makes this worth a line rather than a
footnote: the gate then fails on RACE, so the symptom names a category — a data
race in the code just written — that has nothing to do with the cause. It does not
merely fail to point at the problem, it points away from it. Measured 2026-09-05,
one review away from reporting a race that did not exist.

Use `gates`. Level 2 is the floor for "done"; level 3 is not optional for relay,
claim, proof, settlement or metering. Report what did NOT run.

## Step 6 — your own pass over the diff, cheap and without agents

Name the angles in writing BEFORE reading: removed behaviour, cross-file callers,
double-counted metrics, language pitfalls, efficiency. Measured 2026-08-26, that
pass over a 17-commit branch found a real defect the gates could not: a gate
reporting its units in one mode and not the other.

**INSERTING is the trigger, not moving — and it is mechanical.** Four orphaned
comments in one session, and all four came from the same act: putting something
new immediately BEFORE a declaration. The new code lands between a comment and
the thing it documents, so the comment now heads the wrong symbol and the right
one has none. The fourth was the sharpest: the displaced comment carried the very
example being cited in the new code's own rationale, so the explanation ended up
attached to the fix and torn off the metric that suffers the problem.

No gate sees any of this — the result is syntactically fine, gofmt has no opinion,
and this repo's linters run with documentation rules excluded. So it is not a care
to remember, it is a command to run: after any insertion, diff the untouched
region against HEAD and expect ZERO removed lines.

**AND IT RECURRED ON 2026-09-08, from a session with this paragraph in context.**
A type was inserted immediately before `func (qc *Clients) Proof()`, so godoc
showed the new type's documentation opening with "Proof returns the proof module
query client." and `Proof()` had none. The peer session found it by reading the
diff; the command above was never run. **A rule that says "run this" and is
enforced by nobody is read, not obeyed** — the same finding this repository has
already paid for twice.

It is also MECHANICAL, which is the part nobody had measured. Go's own convention
is that a doc comment begins with the name of the thing it documents, so an
orphaned comment is detectable by AST: parse every exported declaration that has
a doc, compare the first word to the declared name. Measured that day across this
tree: **17 violations out of 1077 documented exported declarations** — small
enough to fix rather than freeze — and two of them are exactly this defect still
live (`miner/metrics.go:1199` documents `RecordShutdownDrainedRelay` above
`RecordRelayDroppedNoKey`; `miner/supplier_worker.go:854` documents
`GetSupplierManager` above `GetSupplierCache`). Until such a check is wired
into `internal/conventions`, this remains a paragraph, and the paragraph has now
failed three times.

**REPLACING A RUNTIME CHECK WITH A TYPE: enumerate what the check was ALSO
doing.** A static type is stronger than a runtime assertion at the one question
it answers, and it silently answers FEWER questions. Measured 2026-09-08: a
`x.(interface{ Subscribe(...) })` assertion was replaced by declaring the field's
type to require `Subscribe`, which is a real improvement — a drift now fails the
build instead of disabling a subsystem at runtime. But a type-assert on a NIL
interface returns `ok=false`, so that one `if !ok` had been covering two cases,
and a nil interface satisfies any interface field. The replacement shipped with
build, vet and targeted tests green, and died under the full gate with a
`SIGSEGV` that took the whole package binary down reporting ZERO failed tests.

The check is cheap and it is a question, not a habit: **write down every input
the old check rejected, then confirm the type rejects each one.** For an
interface the list always includes nil, and nil is the one a compiler cannot help
with. The same shape applies to a `switch` replaced by a map, a validated string
replaced by an enum, a runtime range check replaced by an unsigned type.

**After MOVING code, `diff` against `HEAD` the part you did not mean to touch.**
Inserting a function or a branch lands it next to somebody else's comment, and
the failure is invisible to every gate because it is syntactically fine: measured
twice on 2026-09-05, once between a doc comment and the type it documented — so
the new function's doc opened by describing a different symbol and the type was
left with none — and once inside a function body, where a new branch absorbed the
explanation belonging to the branch below it. Neither `gofmt` nor `golangci-lint`
sees this (no `.golangci.yml` in this repo means defaults, and the linters with
documentation rules are not among them). The check that catches it costs one
command:

```
diff <(git show HEAD:<file> | sed -n '/<start of the untouched block>/,/<end>/p') \
     <(sed -n '/<start>/,/<end>/p' <file>)
```

Empty output means the neighbour is untouched. It found a blank line inserted by
the move itself, between a comment and its `if`, that had not been there before —
and it needs no maintenance, which a scanner for the same class would.

**When you change how DATA IS PRODUCED, enumerate the consumers and walk each one
separately.** Naming the angle is not doing it: measured 2026-08-29, "the
arithmetic of the measurement" WAS on the written angle list, and the change
still shipped validated against one consumer out of three. It was correct for the
consumer that sums per-series deltas and wrong for the one that compares a single
delta to a target and the one that aggregates before differencing — level 3 went
red on a healthy fleet, naming a pod the session had deleted itself. Then the
correction repeated the shape one level down: it created a FOURTH consumer of the
same helper and gave it none of the handling the other three had, eleven minutes
before a commit whose whole subject was "it was the only one reading just the
delta".

So: list the consumers by `file:line` first, then walk each. A producer with N
consumers is N checks, and the count is the cheap part — it is knowing there were
N rather than one that the two rounds above cost.

## The tree — what each finding of a review earns

- **Branch 1 — fix now**: money, data loss, a guard that does not bite, anything
  on the relay / claim / proof / settlement path. Branch 1 does not only say "fix
  now", it says HOW the fix is chosen — that is the council step above.
- **Branch 2 — file it in the queue with its position**: real, not now, and the
  queue line is what makes it real.
- **Branch 3 — say why it is not a finding**, in one line. Silence and "not a
  problem" must not produce the same signal.

**A finding that re-enters a DECIDED topic is not a finding — it is the decision
being re-litigated, and it is branch 3.** Jorge, 2026-08-31, after three rounds
each opened with a HIGH about the same tension: *"that way we stop having these
HIGH interrogations over and over, on the same topic. They're not really
findings, it's just going in circles on the same thing."*

The three rounds that day reported, as three separate HIGHs, three doorways into
one room: a key source that reports a failure makes the manager hold its previous
keys, and holding them is either the protection or the bug depending on which
disk state you walk in with. Each round the session patched the doorway it was
shown and the next round found another. What ended it was not a fourth round; it
was the owner deciding the policy — *an error freezes, it is reported, the
operator repairs it* — and that decision being written where the next reader hits
it: in the operator doc, and in a test that goes red if anyone silences the
reporting.

So, when a round raises something whose ROOT is already decided:

- do not fix it, and do not treat it as new. Name the decision, name where it is
  pinned, and move on. That is branch 3 with an address.
- if it is NOT written down anywhere a reviewer would find it, that is the real
  finding, and the work is to write it down — not to change the code again.
- **the count that matters for stopping is TOPICS, not findings.** A second round
  on the same topic is a signal the topic needs an owner's decision; a third is
  proof of it.

**And the sharper half, which is what actually ended it** (Jorge, 2026-08-31,
answering what he had to repeat): *"exactly this thing of continuing to bring
items as HIGH that were actually questions — those got solved by presenting a
case and asking me for clarity/an opinion."*

The three HIGHs of that day were not re-litigations of a DECIDED topic — nothing
had been decided. They were **questions with no owner**, reported as defects
because they had the shape of one: a measurement, a file:line, a failure mode.
Every round found another face of the same unanswered question, and each was
written up, fixed, and reviewed again. What ended it took one message: walk ONE
concrete case, and ask for a criterion.

So, before reporting a finding at all, ask what it actually is:

- **A defect** has a right answer the code should already implement. Fix it.
- **A question** has a right answer only the owner can give — because it trades
  money against availability, or one failure mode against another. It is not a
  finding, and severity on it is noise: "HIGH" on a question means "I would like
  an answer", which is not what the word says.

For the second kind, the deliverable is not a report. It is **one traced case and
one question**: the operator, the sequence, what happens today, what it costs —
then the fork, with the options priced. `references/` has the format under
"Trace before naming"; the short version is that the case comes first and the
name of the thing comes last.

The tell that a finding is a question wearing a defect's clothes: you can write
the fix three defensible ways and the choice between them is about what the
business wants, not about what the code means. If two rounds of review keep
landing on the same area, that is not a bug-rich area — it is an undecided one.

**When the loop stops** (Jorge, 2026-08-26):

```
run a round, apply the tree
  did this round produce any FIX?   (branch 1, or a reproduced critical)
    YES -> one more round
    NO  -> STOP
hard cap: 3 rounds
```

**"Any fix", not "any finding"** — every round reads code the previous one
changed, so there is always something new to say, and a condition built on
"something new" never converges. The loop exists to catch what the FIXES
introduce, and this repository has that measured end to end: `2ce1d30`
reintroduced the exact failure `47116f8` had just fixed, in the same file, on the
same classification.

**The cap does not exit in silence.** If the third round still produces fixes,
stop anyway and file a card saying **"3 rounds without converging in <area>"**.
That sentence says the area has a structural problem rather than a list of bugs,
and it is worth more than a fourth round.

## Step 7 — close the item in the queue

Write what you did, what you did NOT do, and the evidence path. An item closed
only in the reply is not closed. Issue #25 has an evidence file, hand-over
paragraphs and a queue entry since 2026-08-19, and is still uncommented.

## Step 8 — improve this skill from what the item just taught you

If the item revealed a rule, it goes in the skill that EXECUTES it, in the same
session — not into a hand-over. Measured 2026-08-26: `test-teeth` described what
a closed-set test must contain and not where its enumeration must come from, so
an agent handed that paragraph proposed the tautology. The two halves now live in
one section, because splitting them is what produced the defect.

### When a skill outgrows one file

The rule is FUNCTIONAL, not a line count (budgetkit, 2026-08-26, correcting a
threshold proposed from here): **a lesson stays in the root file when it fires on
EVERY item, and moves to a `references/` file when it has a trigger you can
name.** A line count only tells you to go look — it cannot tell the difference
between a file that is long because it is uncompressed and one that is long
because half of it is conditional.

For a closing skill the same rule reads: the root file holds what the session
closing CANNOT skip; everything with a nameable trigger moves.

## The one-line test for whether this ran

The reply names the success criterion, **what the council said and what was done
with it**, the gate level with what it exercised, and the queue line that holds
the item. If any of the four is missing, the item is still open — and "I ran a
review afterwards" does not fill the council slot, because the two answer
different questions.
