// ValidateKeySources requires a configuration to name EXACTLY ONE key source.
//
// It is a deliberate narrowing rather than a limitation of the loader. The
// manager can merge providers, but a deployment that names both leaves questions
// the key path should never have to answer at runtime: which source wins a
// duplicate, what it means when one is unreadable while the other is fine, and
// which one an operator has to change to take a supplier out. That cost is paid
// on the day someone is trying to work out why a key they removed is still being
// served. So the answer is a startup error naming both fields, not a precedence
// rule nobody remembers.
//
// ZERO is an error too, for both binaries. Neither has anything to do without a
// signing key: a miner mines nothing, and a relayer answers every relay with a
// rejection while looking healthy from the outside. Until 2026-08-22 the relayer
// merely warned and carried on, which turned a config mistake into a silent
// outage that only showed up as relays failing.
//
// It lives here, taking plain strings, because both binaries have their own
// config types and this rule must not be able to differ between them -- they
// already disagree about where the hot-reload flag sits in the YAML
// (keys.hot_reload_enabled vs hot_reload_enabled), which is the kind of drift
// worth not repeating.

// keyringBackends are the keyring backends this project supports, anywhere: the

//
// The bar is "we can confirm it works", not "cosmos-sdk offers it":
//
//   - "file" is passphrase-protected, the passphrase is piped in (see
//     NewKeyringProvider's PasswordReader) and unlocking is cached for the whole
//     keyring; a regression test seeds a real on-disk file keyring and reads it
//     back, and the local stack runs it end to end.
//   - "test" uses a fixed password and no prompt; the local stack runs it too.
//
// The ones cosmos-sdk also offers are refused, and the reasons are not symmetric:
//
//   - "memory" CANNOT hold supplier keys. Its keyring is created EMPTY and
//     nothing in this codebase ever writes a key into a keyring (verified
//     2026-08-22: no ImportPrivKeyHex, NewAccount or SaveOfflineKey outside
//     tests), so a process configured with it holds none for its whole life. It
//     used to be accepted, which meant the one thing an operator could not tell
//     from their config was that it could never work.
//   - "os" cannot be confirmed. cosmos-sdk sets no AllowedBackends for it, so it
//     uses a system keychain where dbus and an unlocked session exist -- which a
//     service account does not have -- and silently falls back to an encrypted
//     file where they do not, in a DIFFERENT directory than "file" ("os" uses the
//     dir it is given, "file" appends keyring-file/). Which of those a host does
//     is not something this code can establish, and there is no portable test.
//     An operator who wants a passphrase-protected keyring says "file" and gets
//     the behaviour they asked for.
//   - "kwallet" and "pass" were never wired at all.
