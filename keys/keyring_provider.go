//
//   - Too NARROW: a permanent failure is reported as transient, the manager's
//     guard keeps the previous keys and abandons the reload, the failure repeats
//     next tick, and hot reload is dead for the life of the process while a key
//     the operator pulled keeps signing. "not a secp256k1 key" used to be a bare
//     fmt.Errorf that nothing matched, so it fell in this bucket.
//
//     HOW REACHABLE that particular branch is was MEASURED, not assumed, and the
//     answer is: not through this keyring's own API. A default cosmos-sdk
//     keyring rejects the import outright -- ImportPrivKeyHex with "ed25519" or
//     "sr25519" returns "unsupported signing algo" (probed against v0.53.7),
//     and hd exposes no Ed25519 algorithm to pass to NewAccount. It would take a
//     record written by a tool built with different SupportedAlgos and then
//     mounted into this directory. So the sentinel below is defence in depth,
//     not a fix for a reproduced failure, and there is deliberately no test for
//     it: a test that fabricates a state no provider can produce proves nothing
//     and teaches the next reader a false model.
//
//   - Too WIDE: a TRANSIENT failure is treated as "not a signing key", the
//     address is skipped, and the diff reports it as removed -- precisely the
//     silent removal this whole guard exists to prevent.
//
// So a failure only counts as permanent when it is a property of the RECORD, not
// of the attempt. A record with no extractable private key (offline pubkey,
// multisig, ledger), a named key that is gone, and a record of the wrong
// algorithm all qualify.
//
// Deliberately NOT here, though both are deterministic in practice: a
// GetAddress failure and an UnarmorDecryptPrivKey failure. A .info file caught

	// A RECORD THAT VANISHED WITHOUT AN ERROR is the dangerous answer, because
	// the manager cannot tell it from a key the operator withdrew: both are an
	// address that is no longer there.
	//
	// cosmos-sdk's keystore.MigrateAll SKIPS any record it cannot decode -- it
	// prints to stderr and returns a nil error (v0.53.7, keyring.go:920-924) --
	// and List() IS MigrateAll (keyring.go:539-541). That swallow is the whole
	// hazard, and it is PER RECORD, so it is counted per record: dirEntryCount
	// enumerates the .info files and List() reports the ones it decoded.
	//
	// How many decoded decides what the swallow MEANS, and the two halves want
	// opposite handling. Both were measured on 2026-08-31.
	//
	// NONE decoded, with records on disk, is a failure of the READER, not of the
	// records: a rotated or wrong passphrase makes every jose.Decode fail, so
	// List returns an empty slice and a nil error with not one corrupt byte on
	// disk. Applying that is a fleet-wide removal nobody performed -- every
	// supplier dropped at once -- so it is refused, and refusing costs nothing
	// the operator did not already have to fix.
	//
	// SOME decoded is a failure of the individual records that did not, and
	// refusing there is what an earlier version of this guard got wrong: the
	// condition is stable, so every later reload failed identically, the manager
	// kept its previous set, and a key withdrawn afterwards went on signing
	// forever -- one corrupt file freezing the withdrawal of all the others.
	// This file's own isPermanentKeyFailure doc forbids exactly that. It also
	// returned before the cache below, so every tick re-ran argon2id over every
	// healthy key, permanently.
	//
	// So a partial swallow is reported and applied, not refused. The supplier
	// behind an undecodable record loses service until an operator removes the
	// file -- deliberate, and the honest reading of what is happening: no
	// process can sign with a key it cannot decode, and a pod that restarts
	// loads the same partial set with no previous state to protect, so keeping
	// the address alive here would only split the fleet between pods that still
	// hold it in memory and pods that never saw it.
	//
	// BOTH branches feed these counters, and until 2026-09-03 only List() did.
	// Key(uid) propagates the decode error instead of swallowing it, and that was
	// read as "the by-name branch needs no guard of its own" -- true about
	// SWALLOWING and wrong about the consequence, because propagating put the
	// record in loadErrs and the manager then abandoned every later reload while
	// the file stayed broken. That is the same freeze this branch's own history
	// records as a bug: one damaged record blocking the withdrawal of all the
	// others. Owner decision the same day: a named record that cannot be decoded
	// is ignored loudly and the rest are applied, exactly as when listing.
	//
	// The unreadable-DIRECTORY case is caught earlier still, by the fingerprint
	// read at the top of this function.
	// The two TAIL conditions below are deduped against each other, and that is
	// all this claims. Both are reachable from one load -- a keyring holding one
	// corrupt record and one record that is not a signing key satisfies each --
	// and before 2026-08-31 a single load moved the series by two for one cause.
	//
	// The per-KEY increments in the loops above are deliberately not deduped:
	// manager.Reload counts nothing itself precisely because every provider

	// in one load are three. This series is per failing key, plus at most one
