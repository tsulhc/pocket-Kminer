//     to the reconciler -- "never broadcast, resend at SubmitHeight+1" -- so
//     writing it for a claim already in flight burns the single MaxRebroadcasts
//     resend on a duplicate. The failure-path persist has NO `claimTxHash != ""`
//     guard, unlike the success-path one, which is why the bad entry appears
//     even though this harness produces no tx hash.
