// TestFilterStakedSuppliers_ChainQueryErrorIsCounted closes an observability gap
// in filterStakedSuppliers' fail-open branch.
//
// When the chain query fails for a transient reason (timeout, connection reset —
// anything that is NOT NotFound), the miner deliberately treats the address as
// staked so a fullnode blip cannot false-drain a live supplier. That decision is
// right. What was missing is that the branch ALSO left the supplier's cache entry
// untouched without recording it anywhere a query can reach:
//
//   - supplier_cache_write_skipped_total was not incremented, even though its own
//     Help text describes this exact case ("chain query error") and the sibling
//     path in resolveAndPublishSupplierState already reports it under the
//     "chain_query_error" label. Same event, one path counted it and the other
//     did not.
//   - the only signal was one Warn line PER SUPPLIER per reconcile pass. With a
//     large key set and an unreachable fullnode that is one line per supplier
//     every reconcile interval — the log flood CONTRIBUTING.md forbids for exactly this
//     shape, and the reason per-entity conditions belong at Debug plus a metric.
//
// Skipping the write is correct (the stale entry beats a wrong one). Skipping it
// SILENTLY is what this pins: "the cache is fresh" and "we could not check"
// must never produce the same signal.
