// Supplier Claiming Default Timing Constants
//
// These defaults are used when no YAML config is provided. They are tuned for
// production reliability with high supplier counts (500+).
//
// Timing relationships:
//   - ClaimTTL = 90s: Time before a claim expires if not renewed
//   - RenewRate = 10s: Claims are renewed 9x before TTL expires (90s / 10s)
//   - InstanceTTL = 90s: Instance registration expires after 90s without heartbeat
//   - InstanceHeartbeatRate = 10s: Instance heartbeats every 10s
//   - RebalanceInterval = 30s: Check for rebalancing every 30s
//
// Failover timing:
//   - If a miner crashes, its claims expire after ClaimTTL (90s)
//   - Other miners detect orphaned claims in the next rebalance cycle (~30s)
//   - Maximum failover time: ClaimTTL + RebalanceInterval = ~120s
//
// These can be overridden via supplier_claiming config in miner YAML.

	// headroom with high supplier counts (500+) where renewal can take 4-8s.

	// RenewRate is how often to renew claims.
