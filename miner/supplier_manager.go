//
// Drain-window semantics (post commit 8eb604c):
//
//  1. The state leaves m.suppliers and its context (state.cancelFn) is
//     cancelled in one synchronous step, stopSupplier, before anything
//     slow: the cancel signal must reach every in-flight
//     handleRelay/UpdateTree before the cleanup in teardownSupplier
//     (Consumer.Close, SMSTManager.Close, etc.).
//
//  2. Once cancelFn() fires, a concurrent
//     handleRelay call may already be mid-way through a Redis write
//     (UpdateTree, ACK, dedup set insert). Those calls now operate
//     with a cancelled context. Each such Redis operation returns a
//     context.Canceled-wrapped error.
//
//  3. The shutdown-cancel classifier (IsShutdownCancelError in
//     errors.go) recognises those wrapped context.Canceled errors and
//     routes the message through the ACK-and-discard path: the relay
//     is acknowledged on the stream so the consumer group does not
//     redeliver it to the survivor (avoiding double-count), and the
//     SMST write is treated as a no-op. If the miner restarts before
//     the stream entry's idle-claim timeout, the entry will be
//     redelivered via XCLAIM and retried cleanly.
//
//  4. DeadlineExceeded is intentionally NOT classified as a shutdown
//     cancel — an UpdateTree that times out on a slow Redis is a real
//     transient failure and must be retried, not swallowed.
//
// Net result: the drain window is safe. An in-flight handleRelay that
// observes ctx.Canceled during UpdateTree returns a
// context.Canceled-wrapped error, IsShutdownCancelError returns true,
// the caller ACKs the message, and the relay is accounted for on
// restart (if the miner recovers) or accepted as a bounded loss (if
// the supplier is genuinely being removed).
//
// state.wg.Wait() below then blocks until every handleRelay goroutine
// for this supplier has returned, so the subsequent Close() calls on
// Consumer/SessionCoordinator/SessionStore run against a fully quiesced
// supplier — no mid-flight writer can resurrect state after the map
// delete.
