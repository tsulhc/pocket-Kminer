// TestNewSupplierManager_ForwardsBlockTimeSecondsToDeduplicator is the
// test-teeth for the dedup TTL wiring bug (found 2026-08-21 while verifying
// mainnet's real block time): NewSupplierManager used to construct the
// deduplicator with an empty DeduplicatorConfig{}, so the operator's
// configured BlockTimeSeconds never reached it and NewRedisDeduplicator's
// own fallback (30) took over regardless -- a well-configured operator
// (block_time_seconds: 64, mainnet's verified value) still got a dedup TTL
// computed with 30. On mainnet that produced TTLBlocks(10)*30s=5min instead
// of the intended ~10.7min, so a relay redelivered between 5 and 10.7
// minutes after the first copy would no longer be recognised as a duplicate
// and would be counted twice -- the exact over-count the deduplicator exists
// to prevent.
//
// Asserts the CONSEQUENCE (the Redis key's actual TTL after a real
// MarkProcessed call), not the wiring mechanism, so it cannot be satisfied
// by a config value that is merely stored somewhere but never used.
