// PublishSupplierUpdate adds or removes an address from the fleet's supplier

//
// It used to also write a per-supplier JSON value at ha:suppliers:{addr}. That
// value had ZERO readers: GetSupplier/GetAllSuppliers had no production callers,
// its Services field was always nil because every call site passed nil, and the
// relayer reads the supplier cache instead — verified by grepping the key's
// LITERAL through relayer/ and miner/, not just the method names, so a reader
// building the key by hand would have shown up too.
//
// Keeping it also kept a latent collision: back when each family took its segment
// from config, SupplierStateKey read ns.SupplierPrefix while the registry key
// hardcoded "suppliers",
// so an operator setting supplier_prefix: "suppliers" made the two collide on
// one key with two different structs writing it — and because they shared the
// "status" and "services" JSON fields the cross-read did not even fail, it
// returned a half-populated struct (no "staked" -> IsActive() false -> relays
// refused). Deleting the value removes that EXACT-key collision by construction
// instead of by validation. A glob collision survives under the same setting --
// SupplierStatePattern() is "ha:suppliers:*" and matches the index key -- so "by
// construction" covers equality, not pattern overlap.
//
// The index is what has readers: balance_monitor (ListSuppliers) and
// KnownSupplierAddresses (orphan-stream detection).
//
// The services argument is accepted and ignored: every caller passes nil, and
// the service list belongs to the cache entry, which derives it from the chain.
