// The invariant: what the chain will bill for a claim is Count() of the root we
// flush, and what we counted while serving is the session coordinator's
// RelayCount. When the first is smaller, we performed work that will not be
// paid for, and claim_leaf_collapse_total is the only thing that says so --
// docs/CLAIM_LEAF_MODEL.md tells operators to watch exactly this counter.
//
// This test covers the recorder's decision. That the CLAIM PATH still calls it
// is covered by the deadcode gate, not here: RecordClaimLeafStats was written
// in April 2026, its only caller was deleted with claim_pipeline.go in June,
// and for four months the metric stayed declared, documented and silent. A unit
// test would not have caught that -- the function kept passing its own test
// while nothing in production reached it.
