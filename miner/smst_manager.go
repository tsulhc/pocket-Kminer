// Package miner, SMST subsystem.
//
// # Operator runbook: diagnosing claim/ComputeUnits loss
//
// If on-chain ComputeUnits are lower than the supplier's actual RPS
// would suggest, walk these signals in order:
//
//  1. Miner metrics (exposed at the miner's /metrics endpoint):
//     - ha_smst_panics_recovered_total{supplier,operation}: any
//     non-zero rate means the SMT library panicked on corrupt state
//     (missing node, malformed payload) and the defensive boundary
//     caught it. Root cause is almost always Redis-side data loss.
//     - ha_smst_corruption_evictions_total{supplier,reason}: a
//     session was dropped from memory because its tree was deemed
//     unreliable. The session's relays get undercounted in the
//     claim (only post-eviction relays make it in).
//
//  2. Miner logs (grep these strings):
//     - "SMT library panic recovered at miner boundary" — full stack
//     and smt_op field show which call tripped.
//     - "SMST node missing from store" — ErrSMSTNodeMissing bubbled
//     up; a Redis hash field that should be present was absent.
//     - "evicted corrupt SMST session from memory" — emitted on every
//     eviction with the reason label (update_tree_corruption,
//     flush_tree_corruption, prove_closest_corruption, ...).
//
//  3. Redis server state:
//     - INFO memory → evicted_keys should be 0. Any non-zero means
//     Redis ran out of memory and evicted keys; if the nodes hash
//     is among them, every in-flight session on this supplier
//     corrupts simultaneously.
//     - CONFIG GET maxmemory-policy → must be "noeviction". Any
//     *-lru, *-lfu, or *-random policy will silently evict SMST
//     data under memory pressure and cause this exact failure mode.
//     - CONFIG GET maxmemory → size for the supplier footprint:
//     ~200KB per active session (nodes hash + dedup set +
//     snapshot) × concurrent sessions × active suppliers, plus
//     stream backlogs.
//
//  4. Miner config (config.miner.yaml):
//     - cache_ttl: must exceed the longest session lifecycle
//     (session window + claim window + proof window + buffer).
//     With sliding-TTL refresh (FlushOrphansWithLiveRoot), this
//     auto-extends while relays keep coming in, but a session
//     that idles past cache_ttl will still expire — keep ≥ 2h.
