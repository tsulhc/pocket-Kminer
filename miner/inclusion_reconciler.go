	//

	// Its one reader is the re-injection stall bound in rebroadcast (stuckSince
	// / stuckTooLong). The resend spacing that first read it went with the resend
	// calendar; the field was kept for the constraint below, and that bound is

	//
	// They live on the ENTRY and not under a key of their own, and the reason is
	// that the entry is the identity that always exists: what a resend sends is
	// this supplier's message for this window, which is exactly what this record
	// names. Keying the bytes by transaction hash instead made the lookup depend
	// on a value that is deliberately EMPTY in the case the whole mechanism
	// exists for -- a submission whose broadcast never answered -- and produced a
	// separate key with its own TTL, its own orphans, and a rule for when the

	//
	// The cost, accepted: a batched claim writes one entry per session, so the

	// and it does not happen at all on the proof path, where one transaction
	// carries one session. NOT MEASURED against production traffic.

	// MaxRebroadcasts caps how many times a still-missing claim/proof is
	// re-submitted within its window. Worst case is that many times the gas.
	// 0 = observe-only (record outcomes, never resend).
	//
	// Why spaced resends from mid-window, and not one per block: txs are
	// unordered with a block-time-anchored timeout that spans ~the whole window,
	// so the original is valid in any later (empty) block until it times out.
	// Re-sending every block would flood the mempool with copies that mostly
	// fail DeliverTx as duplicates. The failure a resend fixes is mempool
	// eviction during the submit-block burst, and a resend into a later empty
	// block recovers it — the spacing is what gives each one a block to be
	// included and a block to be observed before the next is considered.
	//
	// CORRECTED 2026-09-04. This comment used to say that re-sending every
	// block "would build a fresh tx each time (new timeout → new hash, not
	// deduped)". That was the wrong model of the nonce, and it was written two
	// months AFTER the timeout was anchored to latest_block_time: inside one
	// block the anchor does not move, so two sends in the same block built the
	// SAME timeout and therefore the same unordered nonce (the pair the chain
	// keys on is (timeout.UnixNano(), sender)). Far from "not deduped", they
	// collided, and the second was rejected in CheckTx with "already used
	// timeout". Across blocks the anchor does move, so a resend one block later
	// is genuinely a new nonce -- which is why the mid-window resend works at
	// all, and why it is NOT deduplicated by the chain. What deduplicates it is
	// poktroll's upsert on (sessionId, supplier).
	//
	// REVISED: unset now means NO CAP. The two reasons the paragraph above gives
	// for spacing resends out are both gone -- the window close is enforced by
	// the transaction's own timeout_height, and a redundant resend is refused by
	// the node for free as code 19, classified and exempt from counting. What is
	// left is that a claim only earns anything if it lands, so the resend that
	// matters is the one after the block that lost it.
	//
	// nil is NOT the same as a large number, which is why this is a pointer and
	// not a sentinel: 0 means observe-only and any positive value is a real cap,
	// so a numeric stand-in for "unlimited" would be indistinguishable from an
	// operator asking for exactly that many. The distinction already existed in

//     last useful send is at close-1, because a transaction sent there can still
//     be included in close. Sending AT close cannot be included by anything.

	// a second transaction while the first is still in that mempool: precisely
	// the duplicate this whole mechanism exists to avoid.
	//
	// Which other failures spare the bytes is now the chain's answer to decide,

	// already holds the transaction or had no room for it, all leave it
	// unjudged. Everything else discards. The predicate keeps that reading in

	// CometBFT's mempool keeps a transaction in its cache after it COMMITS

// clear removes a settled entry. The cached transaction bytes go with it,
// because they live ON it: nothing survives the record they belonged to, so
// there is no orphan to collect and no TTL to outlive.
// nothingWasSpent reports the two answers that mean the attempt cost nothing:
// no permit was free so it was never signed or sent, and the node already holds
// the transaction so nothing was transmitted. Both the attempt counter and the
// cached bytes ask this same question, and they must not drift apart -- an
// answer treated as "nothing happened" for the budget and as a failure for the
// cache would spend a signature the counter says was never spent.
// reinjectionStallBlocks is how many blocks of getting nowhere end a
// re-injection.
//
// It is a CONSTANT and not a setting, the way this repository prefers: a commit
// that changes a number is reviewable, a knob that can be turned until it means
// something else is not. The value is reasoned, NOT measured against production:
// a transaction the network accepts is normally included within a block or two,
// so three blocks of the node answering "I already hold this" while the chain
// still does not show it means the answer is an echo -- most likely from a
// mempool cache holding a transaction that already committed -- and not a queue
// we are waiting in. On a window of about ten blocks it also leaves room to sign
// a replacement and have it land.
