// RedisMapStore implements kvstore.MapStore using Redis hashes with pipelining optimization.
// This enables shared storage across HA instances, avoiding local disk IOPS issues.
//
// The RedisMapStore uses a single Redis hash to store all key-value pairs for a session's SMST.
// This provides O(1) access for Get/Set/Delete operations and enables instant failover since
// all instances can access the same Redis data.
//
// Pipelining Optimization:
// During SMST Commit(), the library calls Set() 10-20 times for dirty nodes and
// Delete() on any node that became an orphan during the Update. Instead of 10-20
// round trips (20-40ms), we buffer operations and flush in one HSET (2-3ms).
// This provides 8-10× speedup for relay processing.
//
// Deferred orphan deletion (HA correctness):
// Unlike Set(), orphan Delete() calls MUST NOT execute on every Update or they
// break the checkpointed live_root. When the live_root is checkpointed only
// every N updates, deleting orphans in-between invalidates the children of the
// previous checkpoint — the next leader to resume from live_root then panics
// in smt.parseSumTrieNode on an empty slice (see Anaski 2026-04-17 panic).
//
// The fix: buffer orphan digests across Updates and only flush them at the
// live_root checkpoint boundary, atomically with the new live_root SET
// (see FlushOrphansWithLiveRoot). Between boundaries orphan bytes linger in
// the nodes hash — harmless bloat that is wiped by DeleteTree at cleanup.
//
// Redis Hash Structure:
//
//	Key: Built via KeyBuilder.SMSTNodesKey(supplierAddress, sessionID)
//	Fields: hex-encoded SMST node keys
//	Values: raw SMST node data

	// Pipeline buffers — separated because they have different lifetimes.
	//   pipelineBuffer is flushed by every FlushPipeline (one round-trip per
	//   UpdateTree) and emptied only by a write that succeeded, so the nodes
	//   of a failed flush go with the next one.
	//   orphanBuffer accumulates across Updates until FlushOrphansWithLiveRoot
