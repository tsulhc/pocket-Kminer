// What is held is SAFE to lose to a crash: the entries are still pending in the
// stream, the dedup set does not have them yet, so whoever takes them next
// counts them exactly once. That is the whole reason the duplicate mark moves
// into the batch with the counter and the acknowledgement -- marked early, a
// redelivery after a crash would skip the counter forever.
//
// Age budget, because a pending entry older than claim_idle_timeout can be
// taken by another miner's reclaim even though this one is alive
// (StreamsConsumer.claimIdleFromOtherConsumers): the idle time counts from
// DELIVERY, so it is the time in the delivery channel (5000 slots; ~18 s under
// backlog was an estimate, not measured) plus up to one flush interval (15 s by
// default, validated to be at most a quarter of the idle timeout): about 33 s
// against 60 s. On the way out the batch is released, not flushed, so the exit
// adds nothing to it. Past the budget, the dedup set still keeps the count
// exact; what two miners can then both do is write the same tree, the same
// hazard a slow consumer has always had.
//
// Every flush and the release happen under mu, which the consume loop, its tick
// and the lifecycle's claim transition all take. That is what makes a session
// flush at most once at a time, and why entries never leave the map before a

// script that fails halfway is not rolled back (measured on Redis 8.10.0: a
// SADD before a WRONGTYPE stayed written). XACKDEL does not fail on a missing
// stream, group or id -- it answers -1 (measured on 8.10.0, 2026-09-10) -- so
// once the writes start, nothing after them refuses.
//
// The branches copy the per-relay path: there the dedup mark comes first and the
// counter second, so a missing or terminal session gets its relays marked and
// acknowledged but not counted. Counting only what the SADD added is what keeps
// a redelivery from counting twice, in either order of two consumers; and
// adding each new member's OWN compute units matters because one session can
// hold relays mined at different CUPRs.
//
// Re-running it is harmless: the SADD adds nothing, so nothing is counted, and
// the ids are already gone, so nothing is a duplicate either. An error whose
// outcome is unknown can be retried.
