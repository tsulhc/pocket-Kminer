// TestEnsureSharedTrackers_NoBlockClientBuildsNothing is the assertion whose
// absence let a SIGSEGV reach a gate. Making Subscribe a compile-time
// requirement removed a runtime type-assert that had been doing TWO jobs: it
// asked whether the client could subscribe, and — because a type-assert on a
// nil interface returns ok=false — it also asked whether there WAS one. The
// type covers the first and cannot cover the second, so the loop dereferenced
// nil one line in and took the whole test binary down: no test was marked
// failed, the package simply died.
//
// The assertion that carries the reason is the one on the STORE. Declining to
// build the reconciler is not about avoiding a panic — it is that a store
// without a per-block loop keeps persisting rebroadcast entries nothing will
// ever read, which age out at their TTL. That is the state this whole change
// set exists to make impossible, and a nil block client reaches it by a
// different door than the missing-capability one it closed.
