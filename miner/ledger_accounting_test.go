// THE LEDGER IDENTITY
//
//	claimed = proved + lost + (unresolved_opened - unresolved_resolved)
//
// Money enters the book in exactly one place -- a claim transaction the chain
// accepted -- and leaves it through exactly one of three doors. Work that never
// entered the book is counted apart, in the forgone family, precisely so that it
// cannot be subtracted from a total it was never in.
//
// Measured before this existed: a run that settled 500 of 500 claims with zero
// expired and zero slash reported claimed 6742.81, proved 4277.10, lost 3034.77
// -- a residual of -569.06, 108.4%. The same session was counted proved AND
// lost, and claim-side failures were counted lost without ever having been
// counted claimed. These tests pin each rule that makes the residual zero.

// ledgerProbe reads every series a verdict can touch for one (supplier,
// service) pair, so a test can assert where money went AND where it did not.
// Asserting only the series you expect to move is how a change that writes to
// two doors at once passes.
