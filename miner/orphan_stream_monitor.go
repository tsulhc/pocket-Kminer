// defaultOrphanStreamCheckInterval paces a sweep that answers a slow question.
//
// A stream becomes orphaned when a supplier is decommissioned for good, which
// happens on the timescale of operator decisions, not of blocks. The sweep is a
// SCAN over every relay stream plus one over the supplier cache, so it is not
// free; running it often would cost real Redis work to re-learn something that
// almost never changes.
const defaultOrphanStreamCheckInterval = time.Hour

// OrphanStreamMonitor reports relay streams whose supplier this deployment no
// longer has any record of.
//
// It exists because relay streams no longer expire. A clock was the wrong
// instrument for ending a supplier's lane -- it fired mid-session and took
// un-consumed relays and the pending entries list with it -- so the lane now
// lives as long as the supplier does. The cost of that trade is that a supplier
// decommissioned for good leaves its lane behind, and this makes those lanes
// visible instead of leaving them to be discovered by someone reading key
// counts.
//
// It only ever COUNTS. Deleting a stream key deletes its consumer group and that
// group's pending entries with it, and the consumer recreates the group empty on
// its next connect, so an automatic delete would destroy unpaid relays with no
// trace. Cleanup is an operator decision, taken with
// `pocket-relay-miner redis streams --orphaned`.
