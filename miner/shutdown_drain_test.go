// it actually succeeded. shutdown_drained_relays_total documents itself as
// relays "drained... and processed", but a message can be fully processed by
// onRelay and still fail to acknowledge (a Redis hiccup coincident with
// shutdown) -- the entry stays PENDING in Redis exactly like a
// window-timeout abandonment, yet used to be reported as a success.

// first: StreamsConsumer.AckMessage returns an error once closed, without
// touching the shared Redis client the fixture also uses for assertions
// (Close() only flips an internal flag and waits for goroutines this fixture
// never started). onRelay does not go through the consumer, so this isolates
// exactly the ack-failure path from the processing path.
//
// The metric deltas are the actual regression signal: the Redis PEL state
// (still pending) is IDENTICAL whether or not the drain loop checks
// handleStreamMessage's return value -- AckMessage fails either way. Only
