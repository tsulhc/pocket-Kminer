// ScanFunc lists every key matching a glob.
//
// It is a parameter rather than a method call because the two callers must scan
// differently: the CLI uses a cluster-aware scan that walks every shard, while
// the miner uses the plain SCAN it uses everywhere else. Only the CLASSIFICATION
// below is shared, and it is shared precisely because it is the part that would
// diverge silently -- two definitions of "known" drifting apart would show up as
// a delete that should not have happened, long after the change that caused it.

// KnownSupplierAddresses returns every supplier address this deployment has a
// record of.
//
// It is the UNION of two sources, and both halves are load-bearing:
//
//   - the registry index, which a supplier joins when its pipeline starts and
//     leaves when it is torn down cleanly. A miner that crashed leaves its
//     entries behind, so the index alone over-states.
//   - the supplier cache, which a torn-down supplier keeps on purpose: that
//     entry is the chain's answer cached, and the relayer needs it to keep
//     refusing relays for a supplier whose services have been deactivated.
//     Reading the index alone would call such a supplier unknown while its
//     claims are still being settled.
//
// Taking the union means only a supplier that NOTHING claims is treated as gone.
//
// PRECONDITION FOR PRUNING THE INDEX (nothing today removes a crashed miner's
// entries from the registry index): that gap is
// currently load-bearing for THIS function, not just an independent leak. The
// supplier cache now carries a bounded TTL (cache.SupplierCacheTTLFromParams,
// ~2 sessions -- tens of minutes on mainnet at its actual, drifting block
// time, and configurable/operator-dependent regardless — HIGH-1) that expires an entry nobody
// refreshes. During a whole-fleet outage or a network partition, NO miner
// refreshes ANY supplier's cache entry, so every one of them ages out within
// that window. Today that is masked: the un-pruned registry index still
// lists every supplier the fleet ever claimed, so the union still calls them
// known. Prune the index (fix agujero 8) WITHOUT also changing this function
// and a whole-fleet outage will misreport every live, staked supplier as
// orphaned — the CLI's non-empty-stream delete guard stops it from being
// destructive, but the metric and the listing would still lie exactly when
// an operator is most likely to be watching them. Fixing agujero 8 must
// change what "orphan" requires here too: at minimum, both sources absent
// AND some evidence the supplier is not staked on-chain, not silence alone.
