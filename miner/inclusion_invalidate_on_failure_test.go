// refused them refuses them again. With resends running on every block that is
// one wasted attempt per block until the window closes -- and the resend never
// signs a valid replacement, because it keeps finding a cached transaction to
// send. The budget does not save it either: a re-injected duplicate can be
// answered with code 19, which is exempt from counting.
