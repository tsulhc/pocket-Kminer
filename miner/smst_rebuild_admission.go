// Rebuilding a compacted tree holds all of it in the heap: every leaf value
// twice (the decoded frame, and the leaf node that copies it) and every inner
// node. A cohort of sessions reaches its proof window at the same height, so
// without a bound the process rebuilds as many trees at once as it has rebuild
// workers, whatever they weigh.
//
// RebuildAdmission loads one tree at a time. The next is asked only once the
// previous one is loaded, so its memory is already in the process when the
// question is asked: does what this tree's load allocates, its estimate times
// rebuildAllocatedHalvesPerRetained halves, fit between the heap and the
// process's memory limit, less rebuildHeadroomBytes? The first answer reads the
// heap's objects, which every allocation updates and which include garbage: a yes
// never misses the tree loaded last. On a no, the question is asked again of
// the live heap, measured by a GC that ended within recentGCWindow or by one
// forced now, so garbage alone does not keep a tree waiting. The forced GC runs
// with the admission unlocked: a collection of gigabytes takes seconds, and
// the consumers and the metrics read the admission meanwhile. If it still does
// not fit, or if the runtime is already over its limit, the tree waits for a
// rebuild in flight to end. With nothing in flight it is admitted whatever it
// weighs, so no proof is ever given up for memory.
//
// Proofs go first, the one that claims the most compute units first; a
// compaction starts only when no proof waits. While a proof waits, the stream
// consumers stop reading, so ingestion does not grow the heap the proof is
// waiting for -- except a supplier's whose claim is waiting to drain its
// stream, since that claim seals at its height cap with or without the relays.
// The ingestion memory brake holds the consumers through the same pause.
