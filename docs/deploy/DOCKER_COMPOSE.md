# Deploy with Docker Compose

This runbook starts the compose example in
[examples/docker-compose/](../../examples/docker-compose/): Redis 8.10.1,
1 relayer and 1 miner, pointed at the **beta testnet** (chain id
`pocket-lego-testnet`) through the public Sauron endpoints. No chain runs
locally; for a local chain to develop on, use Tilt
([docs/testing/TILT.md](../testing/TILT.md)).

The runbook goes in two halves:

1. **Steps 0 to 8**: first start, with the PUBLIC, unstaked key that ships in
   `config/supplier-keys.yaml`. Nothing is at stake. It proves Redis, the node
   connection and both processes.
2. **Steps 9 to 14**: your own keys, your services and backends, then real
   relays and their claims and proofs. **Stop and ask a human** before step 9.

Mainnet is the same runbook with the values in
[Switching to mainnet](#switching-to-mainnet).

Every **Expect** below comes from a real run against beta on 2026-09-26, unless
it says **not verified**. That run used an image built locally from commit
`daaf6e2`, a commit from before the v0.1.0 tag, and a random key that is
not staked anywhere, so its supplier
address differs from the one the shipped key gives. Ids, timestamps, heights
and durations differ on every run, and `...` marks lines left out.

How to read a step: **Run** the command, compare with **Expect**, use
**If not** when it differs, and **Stop if** says when to ask a human instead of
continuing. Details for every error message are in
[TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

## Step 0: prerequisites

Run every command from the repository root. Set this once per shell:

```bash
export C="docker compose -p prm-example -f examples/docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml"
```

**Run**

```bash
docker compose version
```

**Expect**: `Docker Compose version v2.` or later (`v5.5.1` was used).

**If not**: `docker: 'compose' is not a docker command` → Compose v2 plugin
missing → install Docker Engine with the compose plugin.

**Stop if**: you cannot install Docker on this machine.

This stack needs ports 8180 (relays), 9091 (Prometheus) and 3000 (Grafana)
free on this host.

**Run**

```bash
ss -ltn | grep -E ':(8180|9091|3000) ' ; echo "EXIT=$?"
```

**Expect**: no port lines and `EXIT=1`.

**Stop if**: any line is printed: another program holds that port, and every
check in this runbook would read it instead of this stack. Tell the human
which port; they free it, or set other ports in `examples/docker-compose/.env`
(`RELAYER_PORT`, `PROMETHEUS_PORT`, `GRAFANA_PORT`), and use those wherever
this runbook says 8180, 9091 or 3000.

Also needed: about 10 GiB of free RAM (Redis and the miner are limited to
4 GiB each, the relayer to 2 GiB; `free -g` shows it in the `available`
column), and outbound HTTPS to
`sauron-rpc.beta.infra.pocket.network` and
`sauron-grpc.beta.infra.pocket.network:443`.

## Step 1: get the image

**Run**

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/pokt-network/pocket-relay-miner:v0.1.2
```

**Expect**: exit 0 and `Status: Downloaded newer image` or
`Status: Image is up to date`, then the image name on the last line
(checked at release against the published tag).

**If not**: `manifest unknown` → check the name is exactly as above. If
this host cannot reach `ghcr.io`, build the image locally with the same name
(takes a few minutes), because the compose file names that image:

```bash
git checkout v0.1.2 2>/dev/null || echo "tag v0.1.2 not found: building the current checkout"
docker build -t ghcr.io/pokt-network/pocket-relay-miner:v0.1.2 .
```

If the tag is not in your checkout, fetch it first (`git fetch --tags`):
otherwise the image is whatever commit you have checked out, under the v0.1.2
name.

**Stop if**: someone asks you to use another tag. Relayer and miner must run
the same version.

## Step 2: the node answers, on the network you expect

**Run**

```bash
curl -s https://sauron-rpc.beta.infra.pocket.network/status | grep -oE '"network":"[^"]*"|"latest_block_height":"[0-9]*"'
```

**Expect**

```
"network":"pocket-lego-testnet"
"latest_block_height":"680249"
```

Run it again about 30 seconds later: the height grows by about 1 (beta makes a
block about every 30 seconds).

**If not**: no output → the node is unreachable from this machine → check
outbound HTTPS. Another `network` → it is not the node you meant; the miner
refuses to start on a chain id that differs from `pocket_node.chain_id`.

## Step 3: validate both configs

**Run**

```bash
$C run --rm --no-deps miner miner validate --config /config/miner.yaml; echo "EXIT=$?"
$C run --rm --no-deps relayer relayer validate --config /config/relayer.yaml; echo "EXIT=$?"
```

**Expect** (container ids and timestamps differ)

```
 Container prm-example-miner-run-... Created
2026/09/26 07:46:06 maxprocs: Honoring GOMAXPROCS="2" as set in environment
config OK: /config/miner.yaml would start
EXIT=0
 Container prm-example-relayer-run-... Created
2026/09/26 07:46:07 maxprocs: Honoring GOMAXPROCS="2" as set in environment
config OK: /config/relayer.yaml would start
EXIT=0
```

The lines that matter are `config OK: ... would start` and `EXIT=0`.

**If not**: `Error: config is INVALID: ...` → the message names the key (and
the line, for an unknown or retired key) → fix that key in
`examples/docker-compose/config/`. See
[Config rejected](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#config-rejected).

**Stop if**: the fix would mean removing a key you do not understand.

## Step 4: first start, with the public unstaked key

`config/supplier-keys.yaml` ships 1 PUBLIC key, supplier 2 of the Tilt
localnet (`pokt1re27pw4llwnatx4sq7rlggqzcm6j3f39epq2wa`). It was not staked on
beta or mainnet and held no funds when checked on 2026-09-26. The stack starts
with it and serves nothing, which is the point: every part except the stake
is exercised. Never fund or stake that key.

**Run**

```bash
$C up -d; echo "EXIT=$?"
```

**Expect**: the last lines are

```
 Container prm-example-miner-1 Healthy
 Container prm-example-relayer-1 Starting
 Container prm-example-relayer-1 Started
EXIT=0
```

**If not**:
- `container prm-example-miner-1 is unhealthy` →
  `$C logs miner | grep '"level":"error"\|Error:'` and look the message up in
  [Miner does not start](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#miner-does-not-start).
- `bind: address already in use` → a port is taken → step 0.

**Stop if**: the same step fails twice after a [reset](#reset).

## Step 5: every service is healthy

**Run**

```bash
$C ps -a --format '{{.Service}}\t{{.Status}}'
```

**Expect** (about a minute after step 4)

```
miner	Up About a minute (healthy)
redis	Up About a minute (healthy)
relayer	Up About a minute (healthy)
```

**If not**: `miner ... Restarting` → the miner cannot read the chain →
[Miner does not start](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#miner-does-not-start).
`relayer ... (unhealthy)` → its `/ready` stays 503 → step 8.

## Step 6: Redis runs with the required memory settings

**Run**

```bash
$C exec redis redis-cli --raw CONFIG GET maxmemory-policy
$C exec redis redis-cli --raw CONFIG GET maxmemory
```

**Expect**

```
maxmemory-policy
noeviction
maxmemory
3221225472
```

**If not**: any other policy, or `0` → the Redis config was not loaded → both
binaries refuse to start; see [Redis](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#redis).

## Step 7: the miner reads the chain and sees the supplier as unstaked

**Run**

```bash
$C logs --no-log-prefix miner | grep -E 'using chain ID|fetched initial block|WebSocket subscription established|supplier manager started'
$C exec miner pocket-relay-miner redis --config /config/miner.yaml supplier --list | grep -v INF
```

**Expect** (log lines shortened)

```
{"level":"info",...,"chain_id":"pocket-lego-testnet",...,"message":"using chain ID for transaction signing"}
{"level":"info",...,"claimed":0,"staked_suppliers":0,"total_keys":1,...,"message":"supplier manager started with distributed claiming"}
{"level":"info",...,"height":680246,"block_time":"2026-09-26T07:45:53Z",...,"message":"fetched initial block via RPC"}
{"level":"info",...,"message":"WebSocket subscription established"}
...
Supplier Cache (1 total: 0 staked, 1 not staked):

ADDRESS                                      STATUS      STAKED  SERVICES  LAST UPDATED
───────                                      ──────      ──────  ────────  ────────────
pokt108cdyngrx0x8sh8pgagwk6d574hly9j5764pyp  not_staked  ✗ no    -         2026-09-26 07:47:31
```

With the shipped key the address is `pokt1re27pw4llwnatx4sq7rlggqzcm6j3f39epq2wa`.
`staked_suppliers:0` and `not_staked` are expected here: an unstaked key is
not an error, and the miner logged no warning or error in the recorded run.

**If not**: no `fetched initial block` line → the miner cannot reach the RPC
URL → check `pocket_node.query_node_rpc_url` and step 2.

## Step 8: the relayer is up and receives blocks

**Run**

```bash
$C exec relayer curl -s -w ' HTTP=%{http_code}\n' http://localhost:8081/health
$C exec relayer curl -s -w ' HTTP=%{http_code}\n' http://localhost:8081/ready
$C exec relayer curl -s http://localhost:9090/metrics | grep -E '^ha_relayer_current_block_height'
```

**Expect**

```
OK HTTP=200
READY HTTP=200
ha_relayer_current_block_height 680249
```

The relayer logs 1 warning, `backend became unhealthy (active health check)`,
for the example's placeholder backend `my-backend.example.com`, and
`/ready/my-service` answers 503: expected until step 10 sets your backend.
`/ready` stays 200 (measured 2026-09-26).

Run the last command again a minute later: the height grows (beta makes a
block about every 30 seconds; if it has not moved in 5 minutes, go back to
step 7). The relayer gets
its blocks from the miner through Redis, so a growing height proves the whole
chain → miner → Redis → relayer path. `READY` means the relayer can serve; it
does not mean any supplier is staked: with the public key it serves nothing.

**If not**: `no service factor manifest: the miner has not published one yet HTTP=503`
→ the miner is not running or has not published yet → step 5; see
[Relayer up but not ready](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#relayer-up-but-not-ready).

This is the end of the first half. Relays served, claims and proofs need
your own staked supplier.

## Dashboards (optional, any time from here)

Prometheus and Grafana with dashboards for money, claims and proofs, relay
flow, the relayer, storage and memory, suppliers and the chain are in the
example's `observability` profile:

```bash
$C --profile observability up -d
```

Then follow [examples/observability/README.md](../../examples/observability/README.md)
from its first **Expect**. To stop everything, `$C --profile observability down -v`.

## Step 9: switch to your own keys

**Stop if**: you do not have a staked supplier's private key from a human.
An agent never generates, funds or stakes a key, never asks for one in the
chat, and never writes one into a file: the human runs the commands below
with their own key. The human creates and stakes it with `pocketd`, in a few steps:
[docs/SUPPLIER_KEYS.md, "Creating a supplier key, and staking it"](../SUPPLIER_KEYS.md#creating-a-supplier-key-and-staking-it).

`config/supplier-keys.yaml` is tracked and holds only the public key. Your keys
go in `config/supplier-keys.local.yaml`, which the example's `.gitignore`
excludes.

**Run** (from `examples/docker-compose/`)

```bash
cp config/supplier-keys.yaml config/supplier-keys.local.yaml
$EDITOR config/supplier-keys.local.yaml     # replace the key under keys: with yours, 1 per supplier
chmod 0600 config/supplier-keys.local.yaml
sudo chown 1000:1000 config/supplier-keys.local.yaml
git check-ignore config/supplier-keys.local.yaml
```

The image runs as uid 1000, so a 0600 file owned by any other uid cannot be
read. Then, in `docker-compose.yaml`, change both keys mounts (under `miner`
and under `relayer`) from `./config/supplier-keys.yaml` to
`./config/supplier-keys.local.yaml`. For a keyring instead of a keys file, see
[docs/SUPPLIER_KEYS.md](../SUPPLIER_KEYS.md).

**Expect**: `git check-ignore` prints `config/supplier-keys.local.yaml`: git
will not track it. **Not verified** with a real key; the ignore rule itself
was checked.

**If not**: `git check-ignore` prints nothing → the file would be committable
→ do not continue until it is ignored.

## Step 10: your services and backends

**First, find the service each of your nodes serves, and check it exists on
this network**: beta registers its own services, not mainnet's.
[docs/deploy/README.md, "Services"](README.md#services-what-you-serve-and-how-to-find-yours)
lists every service with its transports and matches an EVM node by its chain
id.

```bash
curl -s 'https://sauron-api.beta.infra.pocket.network/pokt-network/poktroll/service/service?pagination.limit=1000' | grep -o '"id":"<service-id>"'
```

**Expect**: `"id":"<service-id>"`. **If not** (nothing printed) → that
service is not on beta: leave `my-service` as it is for the beta test, and
configure the service when you move to the network that has it
([Switching to mainnet](#switching-to-mainnet)). Never put a backend under
another service's id.

In `config/relayer.yaml`, replace `my-service` with the on-chain service id
your supplier is staked for (ids are registered on chain, never invented: list
them with `curl -s 'https://sauron-api.beta.infra.pocket.network/pokt-network/poktroll/service/service?pagination.limit=1000' | grep -o '"id":"[^"]*"'`, or with `sauron-api.infra.pocket.network` for
mainnet, or `pocketd query service all-services`; mainnet has `eth` and
`base`, beta has its own list), and its `backends.jsonrpc.url` with your
backend's URL, reachable from inside the relayer container. Add 1 entry under
`services:` per staked service; [config.relayer.example.yaml](../../config.relayer.example.yaml)
documents every option, including the other transports.

**Give every HTTP backend an active health check**: without one, the relayer
finds a dead backend only by failing the relays it forwards to it.
[What to set, and why](README.md#backend-health-checks-turn-them-on).

**Run**, for each backend URL (this probe is for a JSON-RPC node; use your
backend's own health request otherwise):

```bash
$C exec relayer curl -s -m 5 -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}' <backend-url>; echo " EXIT=$?"
```

**Expect**: a JSON body with `"result"` and `EXIT=0`. A config that passes
`validate` says nothing about whether the backend answers: this does.

**If not**: `EXIT=28` (timeout) or `EXIT=7` (refused) → the relayer container
cannot reach the backend: check that the node listens on an address the
container can route to, and the host firewall.

## Step 11: validate, and check the stake against your backends

**Run**

```bash
$C run --rm --no-deps relayer relayer validate --config /config/relayer.yaml --check-stake; echo "EXIT=$?"
$C run --rm --no-deps miner miner validate --config /config/miner.yaml; echo "EXIT=$?"
```

**Expect** with your staked keys: `config OK`, then
`stake check OK: every staked (service, transport) pair has a backend` and
`EXIT=0`. **Not verified** with a staked key. The recorded run, with the
unstaked key, printed:

```
config OK: /config/relayer.yaml would start
...
checking on-chain stake for 1 supplier(s) via sauron-grpc.beta.infra.pocket.network:443 (tls=true)
  info   supplier not staked on-chain (nothing to serve): supplier=pokt108cdyngrx0x8sh8pgagwk6d574hly9j5764pyp
  info   backend configured, not staked (surplus): service=my-service transport=jsonrpc
stake check OK: every staked (service, transport) pair has a backend
...
EXIT=0
```

**If not**:
- `ERROR  staked but no backend: supplier=... service=... transport=...` →
  a pair you are staked for and do not serve, which earns nothing → add it in
  step 10, or stop and ask.
- `info   supplier not staked on-chain` for YOUR key → the key is not the
  staked one, or it is staked on the other network.

**Stop if**: you are not sure which network the supplier is staked on.

## Step 12: restart with your keys and services

**Run**

```bash
$C up -d --force-recreate miner relayer; echo "EXIT=$?"
```

Then repeat steps 5, 7 and 8.

**Expect** (the command itself, from the recorded run)

```
 Container prm-example-miner-1 Recreated
 Container prm-example-relayer-1 Recreated
...
 Container prm-example-miner-1 Healthy
 Container prm-example-relayer-1 Started
EXIT=0
```

Then steps 5 and 8 as before, and in step 7 `"staked_suppliers":1` (or your
count) and the supplier list showing your addresses as `staked`. **Not
verified** with a staked key.

## Step 13: send relays

Either:
- a **simulated relay** from your own tooling: real signature, real backend
  round-trip, never metered or claimed. It needs a simulation identity in
  `config/relayer.yaml`; see [docs/SIMULATED_RELAYS.md](../SIMULATED_RELAYS.md).
- a **real gateway** sending relays to the relayer, once your supplier's staked
  endpoint URL points at it. Publish the relay port first: the `relayer`
  service binds `127.0.0.1` only; bind the address your gateways reach, behind
  your TLS proxy. Never publish Redis.

**Not verified** on beta: the recorded run had no staked supplier and no real
backend. What a successful relay looks like from the command-line client is in
[docs/testing/DIRECT_CLI.md](../testing/DIRECT_CLI.md).

## Step 14: watch claims and proofs

A claim is submitted after the session of the relays ends, and the proof after
the claim, each in its on-chain window.

**Run** (every few minutes)

```bash
$C exec miner pocket-relay-miner redis --config /config/miner.yaml submissions --supplier <your-supplier-address> | grep -v INF
```

**Expect**: before any claim, `No submission tracking records found` (the
recorded run). Once your relays are claimed, 1 row per session with
`CLAIM_STATUS` and then `PROOF_STATUS` at `✓ SUCCESS`, as in:

```
SESSION_END  SERVICE       CLAIM_STATUS  PROOF_STATUS  RELAYS  CU      SESSION_ID
-----------  -------       ------------  ------------  ------  --      ----------
20           develop-http  ✓ SUCCESS     ✓ SUCCESS     301     301000  fce30d03f194...
```

That row is from a local chain, not from beta. **Not verified** on beta:
claims, proofs and their transaction broadcast through Sauron.

**Stop if**: a claim or proof shows `FAILED`; report the row and
`$C logs miner | grep '"level":"error"'`.

## Reset

**Run**

```bash
$C down -v; echo "EXIT=$?"
```

**Expect**: `Volume prm-example_redis-data Removed` and `EXIT=0`.

`-v` deletes the Redis data: the relays not yet claimed and the claim trees of
sessions not yet proved. Do not reset while a claimed session awaits its proof.

## Switching to mainnet

**Stop if**: you have not been told by a human to run on mainnet.

Every network-specific value has its mainnet value in a comment right above
it, marked `Mainnet:`:

- `config/relayer.yaml` and `config/miner.yaml`:
  `pocket_node.query_node_rpc_url` (`https://sauron-rpc.infra.pocket.network`)
  and `pocket_node.query_node_grpc_url` (`sauron-grpc.infra.pocket.network:443`).
- `config/miner.yaml`: `pocket_node.chain_id` (`pocket`) and
  `block_time_seconds` (`60`; mainnet makes a block about every 61 seconds).

Then run the whole runbook again from step 2, with
`https://sauron-rpc.infra.pocket.network/status` in step 2 (**Expect**
`"network":"pocket"`, measured on 2026-09-26). A read-only
`--check-stake` against the mainnet gRPC with an unstaked key printed the same
lines as in step 11; starting the stack on mainnet was **not verified**.

The public Sauron endpoints are enough to start. For claims and proofs you are
paid for, your own full node is the better choice: node configs and genesis
per network (`mainnet`, and `testnet-lego` for beta) are in
[pocket-network-genesis/shannon](https://github.com/pokt-network/pocket-network-genesis/tree/master/shannon),
and snapshots and other public endpoints in
[pocket-network-resources](https://github.com/pokt-network/pocket-network-resources).

The limits in `docker-compose.yaml` (Redis 4 GiB with a 3 GiB `maxmemory`,
miner 4 GiB, relayer 2 GiB, 2 CPUs each) fit a deployment with a few
suppliers. Above each one, a comment gives what the v0.1.0 load run
(50 suppliers, ~2,400 relays/s;
[capacity report](../benchmarks/v0.1.0/Relay-Miner-Capacity.pdf), read with
[docs/benchmarks/README.md](../benchmarks/README.md)) used and what to set at
that scale. When you
change them, keep `mem_limit` of Redis at least 1.25x its `maxmemory`, and
`GOMEMLIMIT` about 10% below each process's `mem_limit`.
