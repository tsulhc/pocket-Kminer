// RedisBlockClientAdapter adapts RedisBlockSubscriber to implement client.BlockClient.
// This enables relayer components to receive block events from Redis pub/sub
// (synchronized with the miner's view) while satisfying the client.BlockClient interface.
//
// Used in relayers and miner workers to:
//  1. Subscribe to Redis pub/sub for block events from the leader
//  2. Poll the leader's latest published height, so a silent pub/sub channel
//     costs latency and not blocks
//  3. Maintain local cache of last block (for LastBlock() calls)
//  4. Provide BlockEvents() channel for components expecting it
//  5. Serve a block at a height (for proof generation): the leader's record,
//     or this process's own node when the record is missing
//
// The current height comes from the leader: two processes asking two nodes
// would hold two versions of the present. The one exception is the startup
// seed (SeedHeight), read from this process's own node before the first event. A block's hash at a height is
// different, immutable once the block exists, so reading it from any node
// that has it gives the same answer.
