// The miner rewrites an active supplier's entry every reconcile pass, so this
// TTL only matters once nothing writes it anymore — the decommissioned-
// supplier case. Before this,
// SetSupplierState wrote with no TTL at all, so a supplier whose signing key
// left the miner's keyring mid-teardown froze at its last-written state —
// often still "staked, serving" — forever, with no cache layer left to
// notice.
//
// A supplier legitimately stays IsActive() while Status == unstaking: poktroll
// keeps it serving until the current session ends. Verified against
// x/supplier/keeper/msg_server_unstake_supplier.go (poktroll@v0.1.35):
// Supplier.UnstakeSessionEndHeight is set in the SAME block as
// MsgUnstakeSupplier (so IsUnbonding() is true immediately), but
// ServiceConfigHistory[].DeactivationHeight is deferred to the NEXT session
// boundary only — "the supplier MUST continue to provide service until the
// end of the current session". So the entry must outlive one session, not
// one full unbonding period.
//
// SupplierUnbondingPeriodSessions is the WRONG axis for this, and an earlier
// version of this function used it: that param answers "how long until the
// stake unlocks" (an economic-security window), not "how long until services
// deactivate" (always <= 1 session, regardless of the unbonding period's
// length). Verified live against mainnet (sauron-api.infra.pocket.network,
// x/shared/params, 2026-08-20): num_blocks_per_session=20 but
// supplier_unbonding_period_sessions=1429 — using the unbonding axis would
// have produced a ~40-day TTL, keeping a decommissioned supplier servable and
// its orphaned stream invisible for over a month. num_blocks_per_session is
// the parameter that actually bounds when services deactivate.
//
// The 2x multiplier (Jorge, 2026-08-20) is margin, not a second deadline: one
// session for the protocol's own boundary, one more so a delayed reconcile
// pass does not race the expiry — comfortably above the reconcile interval
// (DefaultSupplierReconcileInterval = 60s; see the margin check in
// TestSupplierCacheTTLFromParams). An operator who removes the signing key
// before that window closes loses their own rewards — this repo does not try
// to protect against that (there is no recovering a signature we no longer
// hold the key for); the TTL only bounds how long the resulting stale entry
// can mislead the relayer into serving it, instead of freezing that lie
// forever.
//
// ROLLING-UPGRADE GAP (review 2026-08-21, not fixed here): a supplier
// decommissioned by a PRE-fix binary already has a Redis entry written with
// no expiry at all (the old Set(ctx, key, data, 0)). Nothing rewrites an
// entry for an address no longer in the keyring, so that specific entry
// stays frozen post-upgrade too, until an operator clears it by hand (`redis
// cache --type supplier --key <addr> --invalidate`) or it is otherwise
// removed. Only entries written AFTER this fix ships get a bounded TTL; this
