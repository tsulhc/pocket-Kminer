	// difficulty per service as the leading-zero-bit count of the
	// target_hash. Gauge semantics: the value is valid indefinitely
	// until the next chain query for that service overwrites it.
	//
	// Each additional leading-zero bit halves the fraction of relays
	// that satisfy the target (bits=0 → every hash passes; bits=1 →
	// 1/2; bits=2 → 1/4; …). This is the single number that explains
	// why ha_relayer_relays_mined_total / relays_served_total varies
	// across services.
	//
	// Updated whenever the chain is consulted: every call to the (uncached)
	// GetServiceRelayDifficulty and on cache-miss in
	// GetServiceRelayDifficultyAtHeight. Cache hits are the hot path and don't touch
	// the gauge; in steady state new session starts produce new
	// queries that refresh the value.
	//
	// Restart gap: after a fresh process start, the gauge has no
	// series until the first cache miss per service lands (typically
	// within one session boundary, ~1-2 min on mainnet). Alerts
	// should use `absent_over_time(...[5m])` rather than plain
	// `absent(...)` to avoid spurious pages during startup.
	//
	// Historical overwrites: GetServiceRelayDifficultyAtHeight can be
	// called for a session that started earlier than the latest one
	// on-chain; the last write wins. In practice session starts
	// advance monotonically so the value tracks the current session
	// boundary, not an older one.
