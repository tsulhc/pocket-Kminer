            # 30s is beta's clock, and that is the reason it is the default
            # (Jorge): beta is the fastest clock this software has to cope with,
            # so the localnet runs there rather than somewhere no deployment
            # lives. NOT VERIFIED, and offered only as a second reason: at 10s a
            # load is believed never to have crossed target_num_relays (100k per
            # service and session, the same number here and on mainnet), so the
            # difficulty would never have been exercised -- nobody measured that.
