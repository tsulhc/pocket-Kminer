        # proxy.go:1097).

        # fired once (zero series for reason="publish_queue_full", against
        # 1.965.145 for the validation one, so the query looked), because it
        # reads batcher.QueuedBytes() -- the stage AFTER the publish worker pool

        # own threshold in a place the gate cannot see. Queue item 368.

        # So do not size this container from "both caps held at once". The

        # 6,79 GiB -- 4,3x, not the 2x rule of thumb, because a queued task costs
