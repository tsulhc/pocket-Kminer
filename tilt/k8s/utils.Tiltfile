    being edited into the file. Editing it is what made every run at a
    non-default block time dirty the tree, and a dirty tree makes a load run
    unattributable.

    timeout_commit is the knob that sets the clock: it is a fixed sleep AFTER a
    block commits, so the block time is it plus the consensus round, and that
    round costs what the validator is busy with. Both regimes were measured on
    this localnet: UNDER LOAD, timeout_commit 10s gave ~11s blocks; IDLE,
    timeout_commit 29s gave 29.05s blocks (three identical deltas, 2026-09-11).
    The -1 is calibrated for the loaded regime, because that is where the loads
    that this clock exists for actually run; idle it overshoots by 0.95s, so an
    idle localnet ticks a second under its nominal block time. timeout_propose
