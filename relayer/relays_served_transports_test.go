// TestRelaysServed_NoParallelPerTransportCounter freezes Jorge's decision so it
// cannot regress in silence: ONE series for "served", with the protocol as a
// LABEL, not one series per protocol.
//
// It reads the SOURCE and not the runtime registry, and that is not a
// convenience. The first version scraped the registry, and a Prometheus
// CounterVec with no observed label values is ABSENT from the exposition: run
// alone it examined ZERO families and passed, and run beside the two tests above
// it examined ten. A guard whose coverage depends on which other tests ran is
// worse than none -- it reports green over a set it never looked at. Measured,
// not reasoned: 43 HELP lines alone, 48 together.
//
// It is an allowlist and not a pattern, because no textual property separates
// the good from the bad: several legitimate families say "served" in their help
// (undeclared transport, boot-window optimistic, dropped, unmetered,
// reward-ineligible). Three per-transport PUBLISHED families that used to be
// allowed here are gone on purpose. grpc_relays_published_total and
// websocket_relays_emitted_total were kept while relays_published_total counted
// only HTTP, so each was the only count of its transport's publish hop;
// relays_mined_total counted HTTP beside relays_published_total from the start.
// Once the counting publisher put all three transports into
// relays_published_total, each of the three was a second count of the same
// event, incremented right after the same successful Publish. Published follows
// the rule served follows -- one series, rpc_type as a label (Jorge, 2026-09-12).
// Freezing the set with a reason per entry is the idiom internal/conventions
// already uses for the bare `go` statements.
//
// The cost of not having this is measured: with a private counter per transport,
// sum(relays_served_total) read 288 against the miner's 768 and looked like 480
// lost relays. Reading the wrong series does not look like an error. It looks
// like loss.

// emitRelay is ONE function that serves both, and the only thing separating them
// is where the increment sits relative to the `if b.simulated` return.

// The first version of this change put it above that guard. The three tests
