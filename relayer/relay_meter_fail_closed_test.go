// budget unknown. And getOrCreateSessionMeter discarded the read error and fell
// through to its create path, where SetNX reports the key already exists and the
// function calls itself again -- unbounded, on every relay of that session.
//
// MEASURED, restoring the discard: this test stops finishing and fails on the
// package timeout after ~60s. A stack overflow is the eventual end state but was
