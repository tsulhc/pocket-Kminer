// Bounds for a plausibly-servable session header, used to cheaply reject
// obviously-bogus client-supplied heights BEFORE any at-height chain query.
//
// These are deliberately generous: a false rejection drops a legitimate relay
// (certain revenue loss), while a slightly-loose bound only lets an attacker
// vary heights within a window around the current height. Real sessions are tens
// of blocks (num_blocks_per_session has ranged ~10-60 on-chain) and grace periods
// a fraction of that, so a 10k-block window never rejects a real relay yet
// collapses the attacker-usable height space from the whole int64 range to a
// bounded band that the per-height query cache absorbs.

// drive a fresh full-node query (a pre-signature amplification surface). A
// legitimate relay — active session or grace-period — always passes.
