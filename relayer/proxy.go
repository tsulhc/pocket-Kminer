// not actually staked for the service, so there is no reward hazard, at worst a
// wasted backend call. When state IS present it is authoritative and the active
// / has-services / staked-for-service gates apply unchanged.
//

	// gateway penalises.

	// It has to be FIRST rather than another case further down, because the
	// miner's teardown writes {unstaking, staked: true, services: [...]} when an
	// operator removes a key, which reads as perfectly servable and only expires
	// with the cache TTL (~42 min on mainnet). Checked further down, that
	// supplier keeps being served for tens of minutes.
	//
	// WHEN this bites: HasSigner reads the LIVE key set. cmd_relayer.go holds the

	// ResponseSigner in place, so pulling a key from the mounted secret stops
	// this running process from serving that supplier -- it does not wait for a
	// restart. Until 2026-08-22 it did: the keys were loaded once and the
	// providers closed, so a removal only reached a replica that restarted
	// afterwards.
	//
	// The promptness differs per key SOURCE, and the difference is latency only:
	// keys_file is watched, so a change there lands almost at once; a keyring
	// cannot be watched, so a change there is found by the reload timer within
