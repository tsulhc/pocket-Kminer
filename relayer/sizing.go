// Worker and Redis pool sizing for the relayer, computed ONCE and read from
// both places that need it.
//
// This exists because the two numbers had drifted apart. The Redis pool came
// from a literal 50 in transport/redis (a formula written for the MINER, which
// opens a connection per supplier), while the workers came from
// runtime.NumCPU() * 8 in the relayer's startup. The relayer's Redis demand has
// nothing to do with how many suppliers exist: it is how many of its own
// workers can be inside a Redis call at once. Sizing one from the other by hand
// is how they stopped matching, the same shape as the GOMAXPROCS literal that
// stopped matching its CPU limit.

// masterWorkersPerProc is how many master-pool workers each schedulable
// processor gets. The work is a mix of CPU-bound ring-signature verification
// and I/O-bound Redis and backend calls, so it deliberately oversubscribes.

// redisPoolMargin is the headroom added to the bounded Redis users. It covers
// the connections the relayer takes outside the subpools -- the supplier and
// cache readers on the request path, pub/sub bookkeeping, the health probes --
// none of which is per-supplier.

// three subpools, and the Redis pool that the Redis-using subpools need.

// reach it and where reverting it to NumCPU would go unnoticed on any machine

// BatchDispatchWorkers is how many writes of mined-relay batches the relayer
// keeps in flight to Redis at once. It is a constant and not derived from the
// processors: the writes wait on Redis, which executes every MULTI on one
// thread, so the cost of one more writer lands on every other client of that
// Redis -- the miner first -- whatever the relayer's own CPU.
//
// Four is where the measured curve bends. Draining a saturated queue into a real
// Redis 8 (loopback, 3 runs per cell), four writers carried 1.3 GB/s of 64 KiB
// relays and 510-550k relays/s of 1 KiB, the most of any count, and 1450-1530/s
// of 1 MiB relays. Eight added at most 15% on 1 MiB and nothing on the others,
// while the p99 of a concurrent GET went from 1.5-3.4 ms to 1.9-9.3 ms. Two, the
// old minimum, left 8-15% of the median throughput behind.

// RedisPoolSize is how many Redis connections the relayer's BOUNDED users can
// need at once.
//
// Validation + Publish + margin. Metrics is deliberately NOT a term: the
// metrics subpool only records Prometheus observations in memory and issues no
// Redis command. That is asserted rather than asked to be remembered --
// internal/conventions has an import rule that fails if the metric recorder
// ever reaches for the Redis transport, and it names this method.
//
// THERE IS DELIBERATELY NO TERM FOR SUPPLIERS OR APPLICATIONS, and the reason
// has to be written down or the next reader will "complete" the formula with an
// invented multiplication:
//
//   - Opening a session meter costs 4 Redis commands and is keyed per (session,
//     supplier), so a session rotation arrives as a burst of them.
//   - How big that burst is depends on how many APPLICATIONS are relaying
//     through this relayer at that moment. That is external demand: we do not
//     choose it, we cannot read it at startup, and outside a localnet we do not
//     know it. A pool sized with an unknowable term is a guess wearing
//     arithmetic, and it would lend the whole formula a precision it does not
//     have.
//   - In eager validation mode that burst is not bounded by anything here
//     either: the meter runs inline in the HTTP handler (proxy.go,
//     CheckAndConsumeRelay with r.Context()), not inside a subpool, so its
//     concurrency is whatever the HTTP server admits.
//
// So the burst is not SIZED, it is OBSERVED and CAPPED: observed through the
// pool metrics and the per-command latency histogram, capped by admission
// control. This number covers the bounded, knowable users and nothing else.
