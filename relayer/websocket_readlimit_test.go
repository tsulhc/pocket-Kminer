// This is the pre-auth OOM path: gorilla's default read limit is unlimited and
// readLoop allocates the frame before handleGatewayMessage checks a ring
// signature, so any unauthenticated peer (CheckOrigin accepts every origin,
// validateAndLogWebSocketHandshake never rejects) could OOM the relayer with a
// single frame.
//
// The frame is deliberately unparseable as a RelayRequest, which routes it down
// handleGatewayMessage's raw forwardToBackend path. That makes backendHits the
// load-bearing assertion: with no read limit the oversized frame is forwarded
// to the backend, so this test fails without the fix rather than passing on a
// technicality.
// establishConnection sends one valid signed relay and reads its response, so
// the bridge has an owner and a dialled backend. Every raw-frame test below
// needs it: a frame that does not parse as a RelayRequest is only forwarded once
// a relay has established the connection, and the backend is not dialled at all
