// The bridge used to fall back to an UNSIGNED response when signing failed:
// it built a RelayResponse with no supplier signature, wrote it to the gateway,
// and then billed it. That second half is what makes it more than a protocol
// nicety -- emitRelay mines the RelayHash over {Req, Res}, so the SMST leaf was
// committed to a response nobody signed.
//
// Owner decision 2026-09-03: "a response without a signature does not exist,
// always with a signature; if it can't be signed, the ws goes down."
//
// Closing is also the only answer that ENDS the failure. Admission already
// refuses a request whose supplier this relayer holds no key for
// (validator.go:112), so reaching the signing error means the key set changed
// mid-connection. The supplier is fixed for the life of a bridge, so the next
// backend push would fail identically -- dropping the message instead would
// leave a subscription pushing into a bin with the client waiting forever.
