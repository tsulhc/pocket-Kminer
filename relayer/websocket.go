// origin, validateAndLogWebSocketHandshake is permissive by design and never
// rejects, and readLoop allocates the frame before handleGatewayMessage checks
// a ring signature -- so the attacker needs no key, no stake, and no session.

// emits its own 1009 from inside advanceFrame, but only as a documented BEST
// EFFORT (it discards the WriteControl error), so the close code the peer
// actually observes has to come from our own close path -- see readLoop.
//
