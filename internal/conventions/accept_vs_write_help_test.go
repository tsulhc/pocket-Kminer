// The relayer has one counter that moves when a mined relay is ACCEPTED by the
// publisher, relays_published_total, and one drop reason that moves when it is
// refused. Neither means the relay reached Redis: the relayer always batches, so
// accepting is enqueuing and the XADD happens later on the dispatcher's
// goroutine. The counter that means "written" is ha_transport_published_total,
// and the errors on that side are ha_transport_publish_errors_total.
//
// This rule exists because the gap it closes already happened. The council that
// decided how to count settled on "change nothing but the Help" -- and the Help
// was never changed, so for two commits `relays_published_total` said "published
// to the store" while counting things that were merely queued. Nothing noticed,
// because a Help string has no test and reads correct to anyone who does not
// know a second publisher exists.
//
// What is frozen is not the wording. It is that each of these Helps NAMES the
// series an operator has to look at instead: a Help that says only "this is not
// what you think" leaves them with no next step, which is the difference between
// a correction and a useful one.
