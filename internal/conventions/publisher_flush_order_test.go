// The relayer's mined-relay publisher is always a BatchingPublisher, which holds
// relays in memory between writes. Its Close() performs the FINAL FLUSH, and
// that flush writes THROUGH the Redis client -- p.client.TxPipelined in
// transport/redis/batching_publisher.go.
//
// So the two deferred Close() calls in runHARelayer are ordered, and the order
// is the opposite of the one they are written in: defers run LIFO, so the
// publisher's Close must be DECLARED AFTER the Redis client's in order to RUN
// BEFORE it.
//
// Get it backwards and nothing complains. The client's pool returns
// pool.ErrClosed ("redis: client is closed", internal/pool/pool.go:57-58,
// returned from getConn at :623) for every command after Close, so the flush's
// TxPipelined fails, dispatchAll puts the chunk back on a queue nobody will
// drain again, and the process exits. Every relay in it was served, signed and
// answered to a client, and it is never written: money served and not billed.
// No test covers it -- runHARelayer builds a whole process and has none -- and
// no run shows it either, because the loss only happens on a shutdown that had
// a backlog.
//
// This is the same shape as TestMissingCauseDeciderStaysWired: a startup
// decision provable only by reading, frozen here so that changing it goes red.
