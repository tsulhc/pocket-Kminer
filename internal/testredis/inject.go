// FailSwitch makes every command a client sends through Process or a pipeline
// fail, and lets it recover.
//
// NOT PubSub: Subscribe builds its own connection (redis.go:1206-1269) and its
// receive path goes through neither hook, so a subscriber keeps delivering
// through a simulated outage. An outage test written against Subscribe would
// pass for the wrong reason, which is the fault this package exists to remove
// -- so it needs a different mechanism, not this one.
//
// It replaces miniredis's SetError. Reproducing an unreachable Redis by
// CLOSING the server is what these tests must not do: closing frees the port,
// and another package's test binary can bind it mid-probe, at which point the
// reachability check succeeds against a foreign server and the test passes for
// the wrong reason. Failing at the client keeps the connection and breaks the
// commands, which is the condition under test.
//
// Single commands need no help: Client.Process assigns whatever the hook chain
// returns onto the Cmd (redis.go:1119-1122), and callers read cmd.Err().
// PIPELINES do not -- Pipeline.Exec returns the hook chain's error but nothing
// walks the batch (pipeline.go:104-113), so a short-circuited pipeline would
// leave every cmd.Err() nil while Exec reported failure. The pipeline hook
// therefore sets each command itself. Both statements were read out of
// go-redis v9.17.2, after an injection showed the single-command SetErr this
// helper first carried was dead code.
