//go:build test

// Package testredis hands tests a REAL Redis 8 instead of miniredis.
//
// miniredis is not Redis where the interesting behaviour lives. It answers a
// blocking XREADGROUP immediately rather than blocking, it does not age PEL
// entries, and its expiry and eviction are approximations. That gap is not
// theoretical here: the stream consumer parked on XREADGROUP BLOCK 0 and could
// not be shut down, and the entire suite stayed green because the fake never
// blocked. A test asserting on those semantics against miniredis is not
// evidence.
//
// The SHARED server is supplied by the environment, not started per test:
// scripts/gates/redis.sh brings ONE container up for the whole run and exports
// REDIS_TEST_URL. Starting a container per package instead is what the first
// attempt did, and `go test ./...` runs package binaries in parallel, so that
// storm timed the gate out -- it was 24 CONTAINERS, not 24 reapers:
// testcontainers starts a single Ryuk per run, grouping by a hash of the
// parent PID, measured live on 2026-09-18.
//
// The exception is the handful of tests that change SERVER-wide configuration
// (maxmemory, maxmemory-policy), which prefix isolation cannot contain: each
// asks for its own with Exclusive / ExclusiveURL -- one container per TEST, on
// an ephemeral port. See exclusive.go.
//
// It is deliberately not the localnet's Redis either: locally that is the
// running Tilt fleet holding live relay traffic, and a test writing there
// competes with the thing it is measuring.
//
// Isolation is by KEY PREFIX, never by flushing. A shared server means a
// FLUSHDB from one package would delete another package's keys mid-test, and
// the failure would look like a bug in the code under test.
