// ExclusiveMaxmemoryBytes caps the container, so a test that fills it cannot
// take the machine with it. It is sized from the largest filler in the tree --
// 64 MiB of stream plus hash in the backlog test -- with room for Redis's own
// overhead and for the headroom those tests leave above `used`. A test that
// needs more should raise this and say why, not work around it.
//
// It is exported because a test that lowers maxmemory has to RAISE IT BACK to
// a valid value, and zero is not one: a store reporting maxmemory 0 is
// misconfigured, and the health gate closes on it permanently rather than
// reopening.
const ExclusiveMaxmemoryBytes = 512 << 20

// exclusiveEvictionPolicy is the policy the production code demands and these
// tests start from. It is the literal rather than transport/redis's
// storeEvictionPolicy because that constant is unexported and importing the
// package under test from here would invert the dependency.
const exclusiveEvictionPolicy = "noeviction"

// ExclusiveURL starts a Redis that belongs to THIS TEST ALONE and returns its
// URL. The container is torn down when the test ends.
//
// Use it, instead of Client, for a test that configures the SERVER: maxmemory,
// maxmemory-policy, FLUSHALL, CLIENT KILL. Those are not keys, so the prefix
// isolation the shared server relies on does not contain them -- a test that
// lowers maxmemory makes every OTHER package's writes fail with "OOM command
// not allowed", and that failure surfaces as a bug in whatever code happened to
// be writing at the time. Measured 2026-09-18: one such test held the shared
// server for 133 ms and a consumer test in another package died inside that
// window.
//
// One instance per TEST rather than per package, deliberately. Two tests in one
// file both configure the server, so per-file would let them collide the day
// one of them calls t.Parallel(); per-test cannot. It also means nothing needs
// restoring afterwards -- the container dies with the test -- which REMOVES
// rather than fixes the asymmetry the callers used to carry: their cleanups
// reset maxmemory and never maxmemory-policy.
//
// It SKIPS when Docker is unreachable, which is the one case a contributor can
// hit through no fault of their own. That skip is only safe because the gate
// counts how many of these ran and goes red on zero; without that counter a
// missing Docker would read exactly like a pass, which is the shape of failure
// this package exists to prevent.
