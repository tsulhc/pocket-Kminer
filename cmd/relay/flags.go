package relay

// Package-level variables for relay command flags.
// These are set by the parent cmd package when parsing flags.
// Exported so cmd package can bind them, and relay package files can use them directly.

	// WebSocket handshake shape and adversarial cases. The two gateways in the
	// wild do NOT send the same handshake, and until this existed the CLI could
	// only produce one of them: it always names the supplier up front, which is
	// the v2 shape. The other gateway sends only Target-Service-Id, App-Address
	// and Rpc-Type, so the supplier arrives inside the first RelayRequest instead
	// (v1) -- measured 2026-09-03 against both gateways. That is the path the relayer's
	// owner-adoption rule exists for, and no gate at any level reached it.
	RelayWSHandshake string // --ws-handshake: v1 (no supplier header) or v2
	RelayWSCase      string // --ws-case: one adversarial scenario, asserted

	// gRPC-mode targeting. Without these, `relay grpc` can only reach the
	// localnet demo backend, so the one transport this CLI could not validate
	// against a real backend was gRPC -- recorded during the beta/pnf bring-up,
	// where confirming the transport meant reading the relayer's Prometheus
	// counters instead of a signed relay.
