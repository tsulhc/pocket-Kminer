// TestCleanupAll_LiveReadersUnaffected proves the `--type all` hot-safe cleanup
// (invalidateAllTypes in cache_all.go) is safe to run while live relayer-side
// caches are being read concurrently. It wires the REAL cache.SupplierCache and
// cache.ApplicationCache exactly as cmd_relayer.go does (shared Redis client,
// supplier cache, ha:supplier prefix) against miniredis, hammers them
// from 8 reader goroutines, fires the cleanup once mid-flight, and asserts the
// observable safety contract holds under the race detector:
//
//   - healthy suppliers never read back nil/empty (any nil is the 503 window),
//   - the contaminated supplier entry is deleted,
//   - healthy supplier entries survive (their L2 is preserved, so reads keep
//     serving even when the {} clear-all empties L1),
//   - the application L2 entry is deleted by the cleanup and the application
//     remains regenerable from L3.
//
// Overlap guarantee (not best-effort): the publishClearAll seam runs after
// every deletion and before invalidateAllTypes returns. The test wraps it to
// (1) assert the deletions are already visible at that instant and (2) block
// until every reader completes at least one further full iteration — so every
// reader provably reads AFTER the deletes while the cleanup call is still
// in flight. Readers only stop after the cleanup returns. No sleeps.
//
// The {} clear-all delivery itself is asynchronous pub/sub; its L1-clearing
// semantics are covered deterministically by direct handler tests in
// cache/invalidation_clearall_test.go. This test's safety contract holds
// regardless of when (or whether) the event arrives: healthy supplier L2 is
// preserved, so even an instantly-cleared L1 re-hydrates from L2.
