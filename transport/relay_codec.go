// 16 KiB is the maintainer's decision (2026-09-23), over the 64 KiB first
// proposed. What the S2 cost curve measured that day: structured JSON paid for
// its compression in relayer time from about 4 KiB, and bodies under about 8 KiB
// did not compress at all, the request's signed header dominating them.

// size limit on relays: a larger relay travels uncompressed, as every relay did
// before compression existed.
//
// The miner needs the bound because an S2 block states its decoded length in a
// varint that s2.Decode allocates before it validates anything (s2 v1.18.6
// decode.go, Decode): one corrupt prefix would otherwise ask for up to 4 GiB.

// its compressed form, and one that arrived with no bytes fails here instead of
// becoming an empty leaf.
//
// The slice returned has at least spare bytes of capacity past its length. The
// miner needs that: the SMST appends the leaf's weight and count to the value it
// is given, in place when the capacity allows and otherwise by copying the whole
// relay into a slice grown by a quarter -- measured live on 2026-09-23 as a
// decode buffer with no spare capacity (s2.Decode sizes it exactly) that took the
// miner's heap from 872 MiB to 2.3 GiB. RelayBytes as Unmarshal leaves it has
// the spare almost always (its capacity is rounded up to a page) and is returned
// as it is; in the rare case it does not, it is copied once here, at the size
// the append needs, instead of by the append at a quarter more.
//
// The spare is private to the caller: the SMST leaf keeps this buffer and writes
// into it, so it must never come from, or go back to, a pool.
