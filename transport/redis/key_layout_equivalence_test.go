// A key layout must have exactly ONE constructor, and it must be the
// KeyBuilder's. Several components were instead handed the FIRST half of a
// layout (a prefix from a KeyBuilder method) and assembled the SECOND half
// themselves with Sprintf, which is the half that goes out of sync — the shape
// that produced the meter split, where the writer used five segments and the
// reader three.
//
// These tests pin the equivalence at the moment the concatenations were
// replaced by the KeyBuilder methods. They are a characterisation test, not a
// design statement: they exist so that the replacement provably changed no key
// on the wire, and they keep failing if a future edit moves one method's format
// without moving the other.
//
// A changed key format is a BREAKING cross-version change. A mixed fleet stops
// seeing each other's state — the miner writes where the relayer does not look.
