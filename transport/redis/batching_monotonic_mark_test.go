// Read from go1.26.5's own source, not inferred: Round(0) is the canonical way
// to strip the reading (src/time/time.go:46, and stripMono at :225-231), and ==
// compares wall, ext and loc (:131-136). So a value that differs from its own
// stripped copy is one that carried it.

// TestTheMarksAdmissionMeasuresFromKeepTheirMonotonicReading is item 388's
// positive control, and it is deliberately NOT the test the queue asked for.
//
// The queue asked for a test that PROVOKES a wall-clock jump. That test cannot
// be written: a Time's monotonic reading lives in the unexported ext field,
// setMono is private (time.go:233-234), and the one public operation that moves
// the wall -- Add -- moves BOTH readings by the same duration (time.go:40-41,
// :1179-1187), while the ones that touch the wall alone (In, Local, UTC, Round,
// Truncate, unmarshalling) do not move the monotonic reading, they DELETE it
// (:43-46). There is no public way to build "wall moved, monotonic still".
//
// What can be tested is what the jump exploited. Sub, After and Before use the
// monotonic readings alone when BOTH operands carry one, and fall back to the
// wall clock when either does not (time.go:48-51). The defect was precisely
// that: the mark travelled as an int64 of UnixNano and came back through
// time.Unix, without a reading, so every comparison measured the wall and a
// clock step moved the answer with Redis healthy.
//
// So this pins the property the fix rests on, at BOTH doors: the pinch in
// DispatcherHealthy compares lastSuccess against the oldest write in flight and
// then against now, and one mark losing the reading brings the defect back on
// its own.
